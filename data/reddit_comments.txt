Keep it up lads! I have to go to sleep so I can't really help anymoreTHAT GUY IS THE REAL MVPThanks! I was wondering how to do that. Much appreciated.It's still thereHoly shit as if he replied to my message!The page at r/tagpro/about/traffic is 4.5 hours out of date at the time of this postis /r/tagpro still written on the wall, or is it gone now?  can someone screencap it for me if its there : )Update: it updated for the next hour (4 hours ago) and the uniques and pageviews bars went even higher.

[Edit: Here's what it looks like now](http://imgur.com/SaKY4HU.png)Cool, you should watch the stickied video if you haven't alreadywas on before work at like 1:30 and there was next to nothing now its packed lol.  i fw the vision, lets build.The push is real https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/62mesr/place/dfnw4rc/?sh=c42b6f21&amp;st=J0YIV7T0This is what we needed, that guy is a legend.Can confirm. Saw /r/tagpro and just played the game for 30 minutes.But honestly move the O over one first.[deleted]I think the flag should be slanted the other way. That way both flags and the slashes in /R/ are all slanted the same way, helping achieve that a e s t h e t i c.That seems to be the most feasible option atmLet's get this blue ball done first. The red one has been untouched since it was created.

You could take out the first /, remove some space etcthis will have to be coordinated, because it will just look like 'spam' if we try to add pixel by pixelMy suggestion:

https://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/comments/62pcl9/my_suggestion_to_make_the_tagpro_letters_more/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=linkoutline the letters is probably the way to go - black?Stop copy pasting then. I only copy paste because I'm guud. Jk I write everything.You're pretty bad. Stop with macros and git gud.I don't know who you are and I don't waste my time hating nobodies.That's very true (Nice One :^) is a copy paste, not a macro, but close enough)Cabbagenah it looks more like fagfaoI'VE CREATED 15 ACCOUNTS. ITS ALL I CAN DO.Probably monitor resolution, I've got a 1440p monitor.

Here's video evidence that shows the "question marked" tile in the photo above is truly what I clicked on. Compare the placement of the dialog in my video to the screenshot.

/u/odrevan (http://i.imgur.com/hh59yJ0.png)

/u/tagprofelix  (http://i.imgur.com/LvoaZqC.png)

The two above both broke it in the last 15 minutes. 

Be careful with your edits guys! We need to be united&gt;  if youre implying brigading griefing from us 

Not implying this at all! As I said before these were likely mistakes and not attempts to fuck it up.

However we all need to be extra careful because for every mistakenly placed tile that's a net loss of 2 grief fixes (One for the tp player that placed it and another from a tp player to fix the mistake).yeah no i agree with you any click in the wrong place is a waste of 2 clicks cos it has to be fixed too, youre dead right!

what i will say though is i just clicked the tile where people keep making the T an F and the name box appeared here:

wait thats dumb i can just check the tile i clicked on instead nvm lol

I just read your edit, it is possible i dropped a tile instead of scrolling or smth i guessyup seems to add up, myb im gonna stop for the night if i cant even control where im placing em lol. gl with holding the sign guys, fair play for investigating the clicks too ron if it keeps griefing at bay and notifies people that their clickings wrong then the name and shame is super effectiveAnyone that does not contribute to the war effort should be banned for at least 3 months 

GET ON IT LUCKY[deleted]shit my b genuienly dunno whats up with that been on the ball i thought altho it is half one for real check any other edits im not griefing

edit; for real does that name correspond to a different tile i wouldnt have put that thereplease remove this immediately, it will only encourage the trollsIf you leave it open in a tab it tell you when you can place another tile lets gooooo folks everyone wants this game to live right?

Also anyone have an idea how many views this is getting?
[deleted]lol no worries, figured they must have been misclicks! Although at the time like 2/3 inaccuracies were TagPro players so it seemed odd

edit: yep it definitely does correspond, I clicked both of them several times to make sure. I'm betting you placed a tile inadvertently instead of panning or something like that.im not even on mumble or anything right now if youre implying brigading griefing from us genuinely i want a push so this game lives! Hoesntly have no clue it looks bad but lol im not griefing and i dunno (1)if i put the tile in the wrong (2) how that wouldve happened if it did[deleted]I'm on board with this idea, we need some coordinated effort though to make this happen

Edit: Let's get it started now!!!

Edit2: WE GOT THE R

EDIT3: LETS GO GUYS TAGP

Edit4: Time to sustain and polish guys! Next stop: Botville!Do it left to right, otherwise people will think you are griefing and are working against.This will be harder to defend though 

Edit: I now disagree with this ^^^^ but I am yet unconvinced of the transition until the whole sub is on board.Not really because, one pixel will not change the whole word now.https://discordapp.com/invite/C8VX9ZSEven as I watch it now we aren't making any progress. I'd say we're better off starting a new one somewhere else. UNLESS we know we have the entire sub working together. The system now is easy to understand, and easily defended by anyone who sees it.
Edit: Or perhaps you're right.... see if we can't get a fancy "R/" finished and see what happens from there. the TAGPRO should remain untouched until we're all ready to rumble.[deleted]I've been going for the tiles turning our work back to white. Figured they're wanting to fix, rather than hurt.We're making perfect progress. yep looks good. we seem to be gaining a load of hits to the sub currently by the way! Awesome job peopleHow to manage the transition though?#It's starting now. Get on it! I'm starting left to right.

#Edit: we need to have a coordinated attack. Everyone at once. Meet me on ~~Grinder~~ [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/C8VX9ZS).

#Edit: We did it! Come hang out on Discord to get the details on our next steps!I just don't know if we can manage the transition and proactively defend it simultaneously. We may never make the change successfully. If it's working now, I don't know if it's worth the risk. Consider what happens if blue makes it to us before we are done the transition and it is illegible. What do we prioritize?**PLEASE READ: The colors are going to look pretty bad because the letters are purple, before the letters had white space around them. I suggest making letters white and everything else blue, or making sure there's a 1 px white border around the edges of all letters.**I love you all so much right now.Link?[deleted]Why not make defending the RHS a priority for now, but build up from the LHS if you have spare tiles?  That way everyone wins![So far so good!](http://imgur.com/TkXXszA)[deleted]We need security on it 24/7 to protect it from those barbaric blues.hmmmmmI see my fears are all for nothing now.Work from left to right, as long as we're able to make sure most people (ideally all) are on the same page it should go fairly easy.[deleted]# I have a strategy to allow us to transition and stop people from interferring. Keep the transition going and follow this:

Pay attention to who is stopping the transition. Find their username and if they are a tagpro player send them a message like the following

&gt; We are transitioning /r/place TagPro advertisement to this more readable TagPro sign as defined here: https://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/comments/62pcl9/my_suggestion_to_make_the_tagpro_letters_more/. 

&gt; Please assist in the transition (we are working from left to right, with same PURPLE letters). Discussion ongoing at discord: https://discordapp.com/invite/C8VX9ZS"Do we have a consensus across the subreddit? What we have is working already. I'll join the fight however it happens, but I want to be successful. Additionally, how do you identify a tagpro player (if they aren't active in the sub, what tips you off?).

Bearing this in mind, I'm all aboard the placepush effort.The blue ball has a pixel missing. [Done!](http://imgur.com/n5WMQgD.jpg)/u/bashar_al_assad, I'm assuming you have like 100 reddit accounts given your activity in NationStates. Do your magic!FAGPRO~~I was allowed to instantly place tiles for about 5 mins~~ before getting a 20 minute wait.  Be aware of timer changes.After this is over, we gotta get this on the sidebar.I like this idea[deleted]Well, whatever you did and however you got here, we're glad to have you on board! Let me know if you have any questions :)Remember to message any user that fucks it up with a threat of "juking" "containing" or "capping" their ass into next week!This should probably be the new header for a bit.[oh hey, I did this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/comments/62pwmi/so_i_may_or_may_not_have_a_way_to_draw_on_rplace/)Oh all right then I didn't fuck it up. Hopefully it works out.GODLY! Super impressiveIt changes things. But it was bound to happen. If this went on forever I wouldn't be surprised if big botnets were hired by companies to advertise their shit.

Gentrification is real.I figured that would be the case, but we have plenty of capable people on this sub, and it would certainly improve our ability to keep it up.If we want our sign to stay, we are going to need to do this. Eventually all of the other groups and subs will be implementing code just like this and we won't be able to keep up without our own.

edit: I don't know javascript but am proficient in Java, Python, PHP, and a bunch more (those are just the relevant ones). Whoever is taking the lead on this please let me know how I can help./u/professorTagthanks for the mention. I have a plan but I dont know if I'll have time to implement it. Here's what the script needs:

* set coordinates for our sign
* two dimensional array that defines what our sign will look like

It will then check all the pixels defined in our area for any "problem" pixels, auto correct one chosen at random, then wait for next available turn./u/datblizzard I saw it on discord.Certainly, but it'd be more work to implement since our sign doesn't follow a patternEdit: If anyone else comes across this I added a userscript to install that makes things much faster. A link to that is on the page below.

Made a site for you to use: https://SomeBall-1.github.io/placer/

Short explanation is you upload the image you want to be drawn (valid images described [here](https://github.com/SomeBall-1/placer/blob/master/README.md)), then select the top left corner of where to draw it, click Load Map to get it up and running, then Start Placing at the bottom to begin.

It'll auto-place tiles where it doesn't match the image. It was easiest to go top to bottom, left to right, so that's the order it looks to replace in. It runs continuously and keeps placing tiles once your wait time goes away. To give you a head start, [here's](http://i.imgur.com/eINwotI.png) the tagpro image it looks like you guys are currently going for, and the top left position of that is {x: 193, y: 451}. You'll definitely want to check my image and that position though.

There's some console messages that are half debugging and half describe what it's doing if you want to take a look there. Just remember, after you load an image, select an x and y, and hit Load Map, it hasn't actually started yet, it's just started collecting the current map (for stupid CORS reasons, it has to go pixel-by-pixel instead of being able to read the entire map at once). You have to actually press Start Placing at the bottom to begin.

Should be noted I could only test so much with 1 account and limited time so bugs are possible, but if there are any bugs I think they'd be more in line with an error freezing it in its tracks, there shouldn't be any bugs causing misplaced tiles. Not sure how much time I'll have to fix things, hopefully there aren't any big issues.

I saw you guys were doing something with discord or wherever and you seemed pretty involved so feel free to share this with whoever you want. Makes it easy to transition to a new image or maintain an existing image, just share it with everyone, upload, and make sure everyone chooses the right x and y (extremely important) then begin.

Edit: Found the discord, I'll share it there and see if people have issues.

Edit 2: I'm not sure if I was somehow using discord wrong or I just didn't spam it enough, but I don't think anyone saw. I'll leave it up to you to share if you're interested.you legendThis seems to depressingly defeat the whole cooperation point of the reddit.   Guess it doesn't take long for the internet to ruin things.[deleted]Hi /u/stirus, your submission was automatically removed because you linked to Reddit without using the "No Participation" subdomain.

there's a link to it. since you only can place a block every 5-10min, try to focus on defending our territory from people trying to mess it up, rather than expanding the blue border or anything. Turning the 'T' into a 'F' seems to be a popular target, so watch out for that.Definitely, we're actually getting some serious attention because of it. I'm ^theoretically using all my power ^and ^accounts to keep it as long as possible.

Thanks man! I'm grateful for the opportunity and very excited for this season.There is a push on r/place that we started over at ELTP earlier which has since blown up somewhat when the aforementioned redditor shouted us out on his very upvoted and very guilded comment under the announcement thread for r/place (https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/62mesr/place/dfnw4rc/) well done everyone who was messaging him telling him more about the game!I think maybe people kept bugging him to include us in his post lolsay thank you.wtf get the man an updated picThanks, I appreciate it. If anything comes up I will definitely let you know :)Please don't be the person that goes to this comment and drops a link to fifty different guides.

That's what people did on previous pushes. It looks awful. It makes people think the game is too complicated. It literally contributed to the Askreddit ban.

Just chill, and trust in the tips system that the devs coded. Focus on protecting our image on /r/place.i just wanted to thank this random person who doesn't even play the game but is advertising for us gosh pk.

but really, despite the iffy attitude I do agree with what you're saying. people should definitely avoid going over there and doing that, just link to the sub and let people learn/join organically.You say he doesn't play, why does he mention tagpro so much then? Anyone knows? Will do, thanks. I'm glad we got on this so quickly.

Also, good luck captaining this season!I'm using my "one" account as well haha.

think this is what we're trying nowwhat are you doing hereBecause when we started the level of trolling was so high that the letters took a hell of a lot of effort to get going. WE DID WHAT WE COULD. Impressed at the maintenance overnight guys though, cracking job :)Is this what's currently happening? Our T is all fucked up right now.

sucks bc i was happy i finally got a doppelganger and we jived for a few games then he started antagonizing me and it got worse as the games went on. we even had one game where we scored almost identical points in a win. same grabs, drops, and tags. oh well.

But it's not like we *chose* the blue side. We just chose a blue border.

Man, we are way to focused on our own thing to bother you.[deleted]I don't think that's us, we're busy preventing our one turning into FagPro[deleted]And if we have enough people, we can make the T even bigger:

[Quick mockup](https://snag.gy/1ciWYh.jpg)That looks a bit obnoxious though. Can you show what it would look like in context?If we have enough people, we can make the T even bigger, so it's harder for others to ruin it.


[Quick mockup](https://snag.gy/1ciWYh.jpg)[deleted]But it's better than being an F half of the timeah k cool thanks! i guess on game days i will just have to do ethernet cable.Alright so i bought an ethernet cable and plugged it in. Disconnected from wifi. and this is my new [MTR](http://imgur.com/a/9MkGO)

It seems that nothing has changed im guessing the next action would be to ask my ISP whats going on or is there another solution?Use an ethernet cable if you are able. The source of your ping fluctuations is between your router (the first row) and modem (second row), which you can see by looking at the 'worst' column.

If you have access to your router, you can try changing the channel settings to minimize interference with other nearby networks. [Wifi Analyzer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farproc.wifi.analyzer&amp;hl=en) is an app you can use to find the best channel.

If the issue with ethernet is the distance to your router, you could look into something like these: https://smile.amazon.com/TP-Link-Powerline-Adapter-Starter-TL-PA4010KIT/dp/B00AWRUICG

Plug one into your router and then plug in the other one wherever you play in your house and you'll get all the advantages of an ethernet cable.We should have it done by about mid way thru next week or so. This got kind of lost amongst a bunch of posts. This map thread the MTC got about 180 submissions to test, so it's been taking a bit longer to go through all of those submissions before meeting to test together, but it shouldn't be many days until a top maps thread is posted.

Edited: https://discord.gg/u8VD6link not workingLink doesn't really go anywere for me..Do I have to copy paste it?

It just bring me to my empty screen.Fixed: https://discord.gg/MSdNGDBHey neighbor, been watching out for your T in Tag, people love to turn it into an F.  

I am a big Deadhead and a Radiohead head.  Love them both. Thing for me is that RH is still playing.  Listen to a song called The Tourist, and tell me if that doesn't remind you of High Time.  Anyway, hope you can appreciate them as much as I have.May be a while before I get through them if I do that, however that doesn't mean I can't do it.  I'm moreso into 60s rock such as the Grateful Dead, Pink Floyd, Led Zep., etc.  But that's not to say I only listen to that, I listen to pretty everything from rap to country to classical music.  

&amp;nbsp;

/u/tehscout suggested OK Computer as well, so I think I'm gonna give that a listen all the way through.

&amp;nbsp;

I listened to Staircase while typing this and I did enjoy it!  It's very different from the type of sound that Creep had.  I think I enjoyed Creep more, but the lyrics of Staircase were much more poetic and I definitley enjoyed that aspect more than Creep!  

&amp;nbsp; 

Check out what I said up there to /u/tehscout about TagPro.  It's a great game with an ever better community and we're not that big so we are always welcoming to new players :)  If you do decide to try it out and you see me online, say hi! Glad we're neighbors! I guess Everything (was) in Its Right Place!&gt;mentions Radiohead

&gt;album ranking instantly appears

One of the most recognized Radiohead phenomena!Definitley a necessary tip.  In fact, /u/ThumYorky we try to be as welcoming to newer players as possible so one of the report options is "unwelcoming to new player," and I would say 90% of people who see this taking place and bother with reporting players (some don't) do report that player!

&amp;nbsp;

My tip is a little weird, but picture yourself irl playing capture the flag... you try and juke other players, you try and prevent other players from grabbing your flag, and you ALWAYS try to prevent them from getting to their flag when they have yours.  I know that sounds obvious, but thinking about the game 3 dimensionally instead of 2 is interesting and (this might be a stretch) beneficial [deleted][mfw two of my most visited subs collide](http://i.imgur.com/VGf72ln.gifv)What is this comment

&gt; OKC is normally listed as one of the nineties, and what would you reccomend?

wtf does this meanBand I saw covered house of cards last night. I literally yelped "fuck yes!" Right as I heard he first chord. [removed]I was more [like this](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view2/2000910/thom-yorke-hat-dance-o.gif)I knew I'd start an argument like this when I picked a favorite :)Oh geez I was born for this moment...

Honestly I don't want to impose my own bias on to you. I guess it just depends on how much you want to commit.

If you are REALLY willing, the absolute best way to get into them is just to listen to their albums in order starting at The Bends. They have gone through some amazing changes through their career and are famous for always pushing the boundaries of what their "defining sound" is. 

Now if you don't have that much time, I would say just listen to two albums: OK Computer and Kid A, which is actually still in order. OKC is commonly listed as one of the​ best albums of the 90s, and Kid A is just as good. However they are radically different albums. Those two together give you a pretty good taste of what they can do. 

My favorite song is [Staircase](https://youtu.be/tFTLxkMmY4Mthough) :) You should listen to that one. It makes me very happy.  Ok, defintely going to listen to OK Computer soon, that's some damn high praise so I am going to trust you!  Thanks for stopping by /r/tagpro!  Come play a game or two with us at tagpro.gg, for west coast I reccomend the Centra server; for east, Radius... however good your ping on the other servers is, they are usually not populated.  Have a good one, /u/tehscout[deleted]wait do you smurf on chord under the name tuturu~ or some variant of mayuri catchphrase, i forget what the name exactly saysAmnesiac is clearly the superior albumTied for #2 with OKC for meYes! Amnesiac is GOATAh weird. Is there a way to stop them? One of the nineties, and what would you reccomend?Nope.I personally prefer Kid A &amp; In RainbowsAny tips for someone who's never played the game?Watch the tutorial videos so you arent completely lost, at least the 60 second one. 

Then if you have any questions just ask, most ppl will be glad to answer. Don't dieThanks, hope you'll check the game out! For what it's worth, I'm a Radiohead fan and OK Computer is a top-5-all-time album for me :)[deleted][removed][removed]Everyone agrees Pablo Honey sucks.[removed]Spambots. I get them all the time over on r/saplings. They take existing comments in the thread and mix them together to get karmaNot really, just report, downvote and move on :/

They seem to come in "waves", I haven't gotten any for a couple weeks on r/saplings but I'll usually get a couple all at once on some random thread.hey mr yorke are you a fan of this postgrunge band called failure? i think their albums are x100 better than yoursOk, let's be friends.  We can start by you helping me.  I never really listenened to Radiohead, but Creep is a good song.  What are some of Radiohead's better songs, and what would you reccomend?  Thanks for stopping by our little corner of the internet :)Help for help. Let's make sure each other's place stays looking good. Depends on your taste. If you like more rough/grungier stuff, I'd suggest The Bends. If you want something more refined, go listen to In Rainbows. But above all I highly recommend that you listen to the entirety of OK Computer, in order. It's one of the most highly-regarded albums of all time for good reason.Nice to meet ya neighbor, and great job keeping your pixels safe!Let's just hope neither of us disappear completely Type !mods in chat to summon a moderator if someone is excessively dick-ish, or working against their team or whatever

Alternatively click on their ball to open up a report menu. Generally we prefer !mods only for emergencies but it's there if you need.My two loves 

*swoon*[removed]keep in mind, each of Radiohead's albums has a different style to it, so if you don't like a particular one you might like the next one ;)One of the nineties, and what would you reccomend?oooof someone on chord got same idea as uI think it looks better as is.This is just a rough Photoshop comp I made up in like 5 minutes. It will be more polished than this. The only big difference between this and what it is now is the flipped red ball, which many people in the Discord are in favor of.On individual pageshttp://i.imgur.com/QqfS5xM.png

It's awesome that all of the communities are respecting each other. For example, we intentionally are not encroaching on our radiohead neighborThis and the NFL Survivor game have been some of the best/most useless waste of my time in the past year and they are both going on.  It's fantastic.what is NFL Survivor???A useless game over on r/NFL.  Every day one team is voted off through polls.  The problem however is all of the most hated fan bases/most winning fan bases knew they would get voted first.  So the pats/steelers/packers/giants/etc teamed up in r/evilleagueofevil to ban together to vote off a random team each day.  The r/coalitionagainstevil was created in response for a lot of the smaller teams to try and combat this by trying to get everyone else involved.  We initially just voted pats but that didn't work.  Went with the giants once and realized only going for the pats stood a chance.  It's dying down now because the ELoE has too many subs for the CAE to beat them and once your team is kicked off you kind of lose interest.that would be a really nice finishing touch.
EVERYONE GET ON DISCORD AND DUST OFF YOUR REDDIT THROW-AWAY ACCOUNTSWHAT HAVE I DONE^E^E^E^E^E^E^E^E^E^E^E^EWhen I saw the triangle I scared that we were making Bigmouth.Weekly "What's your favorite webgame" question, but we're gonna delete any reference to tagpro[Suggestion] Can we get the white pixels in our name to alternate white/gray to simulate the tile appearance?You guys aren't joking around.I mean when you advertise so hard the entire sub is banned from /r/askreddit...I was bored, and it makes me thankful that you enjoyed it haha..  congratulations :)I only have 4296 :(right?This is the greatest thing I've ever seen hahahahah, I love it.

Please tell me you've seen [Black Dynamite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D97gwGlMFE) and that's where the inspiration came from? Ending is a little NSFW

I know! I have no idea why people would downvote your comment, my only guess is they probably just skimmed the top and assumed it was a random copy pasta and not a genuine debunking of the conspiracy theory surrounding my 10000 caps. 

No worries though, their loss. I definitely appreciated it, made me laugh at multiple parts so thanks :)wow scrub took you that long git gudGrats bbyPlsI got 0 points on it! but i am glad you appreciated it hahaWhat the fuckCongrats man!  That's a lot of caps!  In fact, if you were to donate ten caps to every baby in England &amp; Wales born in 2015 who shares my name, **Tyler**, you would have **520** remaining which is the area code for **Tuscon, AZ** and the vast majority of southern AZ.  In the 520 area code are Superior (w/ population **2916**), Cornville (**3335**), Sells (**2799**), and Arivaca (**909**).  If you add the population of these 4 areas, you get ***9959***.  When you get how many caps you have minus that number, we get **41**.  When you divide 41 by the number of letters in ***NEUhusky***, you get **26.26**.  So *obviously* 26 is important.  If we do the math correctly, the amount of times the letter **v** appeared before this sentence (**8**) is the same number of days until **Hugh Hefner's birthday**, Apr 9... 1926!  What a coincidence... 26 is the number that we found out was *obviously* important!  Now if we take a look at some numbers, we can see that my name has a value of **82** (s = 27, a = 1; 27+27+27+1=82).  The **82nd day of the year** is **March 23rd**, keep this day in mind.  Now at the time of writing this (3:11 AM EST), NEUhusky, you have **171 degrees** and need **16 wins to advance** a degree.  171 + 16 is **187**... using this number we can even tie in politics to see where this conspiracy-rabbit hole takes us!  **187** days ago was ***September 26, 2016***, which happens to be the day on which the first *Trump vs. Clinton
debate* took place.  We can all agree that this was/is an event that is **split**ting Americans pretty severely.  A person who causes us to **split** a gut is **Flavor Flav** (I split a gut everytime I hear "Yeaaaaaaaaa Boiiiiiiiiii").  Flavor Flav is **58** years old right now.  Interestingly enough, the distance from **Frederick County, Virginia** and **Winchester, Virginia** is **6.1 miles** walking (remember that number)!  If you take the degrees of each player with stats on in this game you get **555** if you divide that by the number of seconds into the second minute you scored your cap at (**11**), you get **50.48275**.  This is where I have no idea how I made this work and it gets a little creepy!  If you take **50.48275** and divide it by the number of players in a game of TagPro (**8**), you get ***6.3103*** (we'll use this number again in a minute).  If we search, we can find out that the time it would take to get from Frederick County, VA to Appomattox Court House in Virginia (where Robert E. Lee surrendered) is **2 hours and 56 minutes** (via I-81S). So we have 2h56m, if we get rid of the letters, we have the letter **256**.  Now, to get the next stepping stone, we have to take 256 and divide it by the answer to this equation which uses a single digit: ((the number of letters in my name + that number squared) divided by the same number).  That seems kinda tricky so I'll rewrite it with numbers: **((4+4^2)/4)**.  We can solve that equation for **5**.  If we divide that earlier number, 256, by 5 we get ***51.2***.  If we take 51.2 and multiply it by the number we got earlier, 6.3103 we get ***323***.  Do you have any guess as to why this number is significant?  I'll give you a couple seconds to think about it.  

&amp;nbsp;

...

&amp;nbsp;

If you think you have it, you'll find out if you were right or wrong in a couple seconds... That number **323** could be given a slash and would look like a date we already mentioned... You guessed it, that date is **March 23rd**.  This is about to get really weird...  **An event took place on March 23rd in both Frederick County, VA and Winchester, VA**.  If we do some searching on Google, we find out that on **March 23rd, 1862** in those counties, there was an event known as the '***First Battle of Kernstown***.'  At this battle, General Stonewall **Jackson** and the confederates were defeated. I don't know about you, but this can't be random... If I subtract **1862** from **2017** to find out how long it's been since then, I learn that it has been ***155*** years, try and remember the number ***155*** for later.  Well I wanted to research similar to where I started and I found out that (according to babycenter.com) Jackson was the most popular male name in the US in 2016, which is odd as it is the surname of the aforementioned defeated confederate general.  I'm beginning to smell a conspiracy.  I wondered if the name Jackson was as popular in England &amp; Wales and I end up finding out that **818 Jacksons were born there in 2015**.  818.  Do you know what is odd about that number?  I do... it is a **palindrome**.  So I decided to look up some **palindromes** to see if I could figure out where these numbers were guiding me.  I goto **palindromelist.net** and think about which letters could be most significant.  I thought maybe an '**N**' for NEUhusky, but then I thought that that would be too obvious. After pondering, I decided that the word '**husky**' would lead me somewhere.  I find out that there are 3 breeds (Malamut, Alaskan, and Siberian) that are generally regarded as huskies, so I guess **3** must be significant.  I then click the letter '**H**' and click the third **palindrome down**... this is what it read: "**HARASS SARAH.**"  I thought I was at a dead end, I was thinking about this **HARASS SARAH** for a couple minutes getting no where, when I backtracked.  I decide to go research the word 'husky' more because if I *had* to pick a code word, that would be a good one.  So we have a player named **NEUhusky**, which is **Northeastern University** Husky.  NEU is located in **Boston, MA**.  I decide to look for husky breeders in the state.  I come accross the **2015-2016 SHCA Referral Directory** (http://www.shca.org/shcahp4f.htm) and see that there are 3 breeders in MA.  I once again hit a wall and stare at these 3 people curious as to where they will lead me next.  

So I decided to just run numbers and see if they could help me find a crack in this conspiracy case.  Your combined post and comment karma (**1111**) minus mine (**753**) = **358**.  Your top 3 submitted posts have an average karma of **50**.  If I take 50 more away, we get **308**, which we may use soon.  If we look at your profile and sort by 'top,' your top post has 3 numbers associated in it: **57** (karma), **18** (comments), and **8** (months).  If we multiply these together we get **8208**.  If we subtract the number got just a minute ago, 308, from 8208 we get **7900**.  I decided to take another look at your account and I ended up just staring at it for a while.  Then, all of the sudden, it stuck out like a sore thumb: your post karma is a **palindrome :O**  So I decided to multiply your post karma (**242**) by **7900** and it equals a huge number of 1911800.  I thought this number was big on purpose, but I couldn't figure out why... I then went to YouTube and searched '**NEUhusky sass**' and found this video: **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouRrKt4kQWE**  at the time of this comment, this video has **450** views.  I took 450 and divided it by the sum of the digits of the date and the digits of the length (2+2+4+2+0+1+5+2+3+4=25).  **450/25 is 18**.  I then understood, it was really clear as day /u/NEUhusky.  I must add 18 to 1911800 to get ***1911818***.  I imagine how you felt when you got your 10,000th cap is similar to how I felt when I realized 1911818 isn't one number, but 5.  **19-1-18-1-8**.  When you convert these numbers to letters, it spells '**SARAH**.'  And remember '**HARASS SARAH**?'  I decided to research if there was a famous Sarah from NEU, but there was not.  I decided to expand it to Boston and found a woman named **Sara Diamond**.  I found out that this woman is an author who writes about the secret religious Republican agenda.  Odd.  Lots of politics and diversion in this comment research.  I decided to take a look at Ms. Diamond's first book, *Spiritual Warfare: the Politics of the Christian Right*.  I found it on Amazon (*https://www.amazon.com/Spiritual-Warfare-Politics-Christian-Right/dp/0896083624*).  When I added the digits of the ISBN-10 and ISBN-13, I got **114**.  Now on the same Amazon page if we look at the 2nd review, we see that it was submitted in February, 2002.  That means we have the digits **2/2002**.  If we get rid of the dash, we can (almost) continue the **palindrome** theme and turn these numbers into a **palindrome** (kind of): ***2 x 20 + 2***.  This equation = **42**.  If we add this number to the other numbers we got on **Sara Diamond's Amazon page**, we get **156**.  Once again, we see the obvious code of letter to number and vice versa.  **1-5-6**.  If we read these numbers as letters, we get **AEF**.  Now because I wanted to stay in the right general area, I googled **AEF Boston**, and came across this: **https://www.aefboston.org/**  Since there were a bunch of 2's on the Amazon, I clicked the second tab, '**Events**.'  On this page there are two events, one in August and the other one... the date is once again a **palindrome**.  The date for this one is **01/21/2016**.  If we drop the dashes and space it, we get **01 21 20 16**, which looks like another number to letter code.  **AUTP**.  So I search AUTP and nothing comes up.  So I enter **AUTP.com**.  On the top of this website are two phone numbers.  I add **1 + 7 + 8 + 1 + 3 + 7 + 3 + 6 + 8 + 4 + 7 + 8 + 5 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 8 + 6 + 57 + 4** which is the phone numbers, AUTP in numeric, and 4 for 4 letters.  I end up with ***155***.  AS IN ***155*** FROM EARLIER.  So this part was a process of trial and error for a while, but eventually this is what I found: **k=11 o=15 r=18 s=19 o=15   t=20 a=1 g=7 p=16 r=18 o=15**... 11+15+18+19+15+20+1+7+16+18+15=***155***!  THE ANSWER AND REASON FOR YOUR 10,000th CAP IS "**KORSO TAGPRO**." but good job... and what the fuck am i doing? jesus christ, tyler make some friends

https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/62q1z6/lets_draw_the_firefox_logo_on_rplace_i_started_at/Where is the discord link?Welcome! It's already been done :)

There've been a few posts here from other guys from /r/radiohead, and we hung out on discord earlier too.https://discord.gg/GYdAytMThanks!How would you know though? For example, I could log off and smurf as a some ball and nobody could know that. I agree that smurfing is pretty dumb, but there isn't really a way to stop itThis is how the holocaust starts That would take too much work. Mods would have to go out of their way to look at every individual IP. Plus, VPNs.Just treat everyone according to how they play.

If they are new, give useful advice politely.

If they agree good players hiding under a sb, play regularly and win

If they are actively working against the team or being rude, report.IP?just focus on maintaining the central structure for as long as possibleHaving a defined border will help do that though. Wish we had higher res of this! You can really tell when the discord transition occurred though!this is a much better timelapse btw: http://spacescience.tech/place/upvotedI downvote every single Trapsin post.

I downvoted this one twice.[deleted]I downvote every single goodbye post.  

I downvoted this one twice. ah what the fricc ive been beanedyou missed out on your chance to get goodbye upvotes 

you don't actually have to quit just say your quitting and bring in the karmaBased on my post scores, you can't be the only one.shhhh upvoting as we speak bb miss uLast night had a really solid upturn of folks. And there is a clear upturn in subreddit visits. Last night, we had 60 on sphere, 60 on Centra, and 190 on Radius at one point. Chances are, we're more likely to see people show up at night anyways. Give it a little bit of time, there will be people that stick around!Yeh same i probably only played about 15-25 pub games last night and met 5 people from the /r/place push.It's Saturday and Origin/Pi/Sphere/Orbit are sitting at 0 players. Pushes are a joke and don't work any more. If there is actually a spike in players today, it's probably to check if there is an April Fools event or not like I did. Pushes don't build the community like they did several years ago. Kongregate proved this when all the new players played a few games and left.But don't let that distract you from the fact that the Falcons blew a 28-3 lead in the Super BowlBe nice to new players, it isnt that hard. If you are struggling with it try turning off stats. [deleted]ty          L O L O L O L

A lot better than I thought I'd get.I'm average too bby.That's a pretty average cap though.[when someone is on their journey to 75% and sees new players piling in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isP5srWOz0c)I mean, play with stats off then?Oh idc about stats I was just making a meme :PLet's cater to them like we did with the Kongregate push. Sure built this community up.11/10 maomeI request everyone play with Stats off. Please, just mess around.:thinking:Some people think direct insults from an anonymous name is friendly banter.Thankfully I forgot about my reputation long agolol god damn 🔥Helllll noSort of sad this has to be said, shouldn't we act like this all the time? I mean you don't have to be as "gentle" as you can be but some basic decency should be standard.share the love!Hey, I came from Kongregate and I heard the community loves me. Maybe? :-)Not many people want to play a game where they are forced into a 15% win chance and constant harassment. It's almost like if there was a way to make matches balanced better than complete randomness, maybe these people would stay. 

I'm up for discussiom on it, but I really think that when people try this game and see how good players are and get their ass kicked for 4 months, it makes them view the game as "a game that's going to take a decent time investment to really have fun in it". So when people feel that way about the game, they compare it to other games that take a similar investment of time. If it was a game you could just pop on and have fun and have around 40-50 win percent, they'd compare it to other games where they can pop in for 10 minutes and have fun and talk to people.lighght hits us if we disobey him.haha xDI think this is a great idea! r/place already has a 5x5 logo so I'd imagine it would be rather easy to make a flair.Discovered this game on r/place and I love itGotta make sure the /r/place image doesn't keep getting turned into Fagpro thoughhhSerious question, what caused that dip in 2016?Hmm. Well there probably wasn't that many unsubscribers. I guess we'll wait for the reddimetrics to update.ARE YOU GUYS TIRED OF WINNING YET?Thanks, /u/mud_born!We may have people back, but we'll never have Origin back ...  RIP ORIGIN  ^^^^^^^^i'll ^^^^^^^^never ^^^^^^^^forget ^^^^^^^^youWoooooo!That's awesome.we're back to 2016 sub numbers boys. it's only upwards from here.We have the best subscribers don't we folks?I think a lot of us are pretty busy with placing too, so player counts may seem low np :)Nah its prob just /u/DillyisGOODATTAGPRO buying 8000 computers....Welcome!You should try the game too, its pretty fun!I noticed that many other subreddits had the same dip, so maybe it was when Reddit deleted a bunch of inactive accountsGlad to hear it.  We love new players.  Don't listen to any bad apples you may come across.  The community is what gave rise to the sign.  We like it here and gave a lot of effort to show it to others.That's the total number of people who hit the subscribe button, not the change in subscriber count.Apparently the translation to new people playing the game is pretty low, but I'm guessing a lot of people pre-occupued with /r/place have bookmarked it.

This is the biggest subscriber increase in 996 days.According to https://www.reddit.com/r/tagpro/about/traffic, we've gotten 243 subs so far today.[We have had half (~8000) unique subreddit views on the 1st April as the whole of March](https://i.gyazo.com/6d5575a95b01538ee187f975d5ecc072.png)

Also the subreddit metrics bar doesn't show the growth today, so I'd say the traffic stats are more accurate as long as people haven't unsubscribed

261 now, love it.:DThe final count is 303. Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/about/trafficWith the metrics page finally considering 1st April over, it reached over 300 new subs, plus about 50 so far from 31st March and 2nd April that couldn't be considered part of a normal strong growth day.turn stats back on then bitchhttp://imgur.com/a/PeGVHowen is owning it[?](https://gyazo.com/8377e7eeceb566fd6a28e4657cbef9b2)http://i.imgur.com/SnhSwij.png[?](https://gyazo.com/7e1fca506da2baf9e70ad7cd119ae1ff)ur such a fucking nerdLOLBut feel free to keep fixing the letters! :)Meh, overcrowding it distracts from the message.

The boosts and bombs will make it more cluttered and attract less attention. If anything, we should focus on creating a double black border for us and /r/radiohead.I agree it's just making it look messy i think something like the NF flag idea that they had before coming out of the top would be fine but the bottom should be left.the Void from 4chan is trying to use current black pixels to increase their growth rate and then swallow art. It's a bad idea to have a black border imo, esp. with how close we are to the core.change the link from sheet to an image of the designI think the bomb looks dumbi agree

Someone come up with something better please. This has been a boring April Fools.Protecting, our message is completeHaha no worries, you can always come on IRC to talk to the mods too! The link is in the sidebar. You actually got kicked by the auto-afk system tagpro has.

If you do not move (or change your key press) for 30 seconds the game will kick you.

This time is set to 10 seconds at the start of a game.

You can press the space bar as a no-op key to avoid movement but let the game know that you are not afk!

Typing in chat (even the space bar) does not count, so be sure to do it outside of chat boxes![deleted][deleted]boopbopboopDeleted because this should have been a self post.Sam's just looking out for the Nordic folkIt says BST?!?!technically, kindaIt's not even midnight in BST yet lol.

Yes I flame people. But as a rule I only shit on good players/friends (they get I'm joking hopefully).This explains a lot. Always. Welcome! Check out the Wiki and browse the subreddit to learn more about the game and how to get more involved in the community. We're glad to have you!TIL we have a WikiHe had an old account with 80+ degrees with a sub 50 win rate too actually. He's trying pretty hard now from the looks of it.Hey globoh man im sorry :(

 you're stuck here now, it will be 2.5 years before you probably escapeNice. Welcome man.I made a new account to improve my win rate once. Turns out I just have a 35% win rate.holy toxicme irlyou do need coaching though? :pPro tip the game gets extra fun around certain holidays. Said the most average ball to grace Tagpro. I dont even know if you remember that joke on your ascent to high degree status awhile back...I remember logging on and always running into you on Pi.

&lt;3I will now put you in my auto-insult-script as target. hue[deleted]At least he tries!My life is finally complete!Much love and welcome! Great game with great people, hope you enjoy it &lt;3i teach lessons for 8$ / hourWelcome!

Ignore the high degree players being angry, there's a few of them around. Don't let them get to you! Other players will usually call them out on it, or vote for unwelcoming :)Satan is an angry, high degree player.

Should be obvious but if it's not, /swelcomeOh ya? Well I love you! Take thatMon Jollo? Been seeing that guy a few times today, and kept saying "I need coaching." He seemed to play TP better than some 30+ degrees, although it was obvious he was still very new....this hurts even though you're being nice.

I started playing a while ago and stopped, I just suck at tagpro

Be a pity if it was just a bunch of /r/place spinoffs.[The War of Art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVtveM13pDY)[deleted]For the most part i like all the rotation maps so for you maybe you enjoy it but 2 is enough for me but 3 in a row is too many and 7 NF in a row for me i do not like either. RNG :/Bad luck isn't just 1 definition it can come in higher or lower severity. 

I never really said myself that i had bad luck it was implied from being told it was bad luck as i found this happened a lot more often after they "fixed" the percentages for the rotation.I don't see any bad luck...RNG?
Random Number Generator

Maps are decided by this, it's just random what map you get, and it's independent of the previous choice, so there's not much you can really do about it.I am sure there is another type of random generation that they could do that would spawn the maps appropriately but i'm sure it's probably a lot harder to setup and maintain.

Yes i know they are not going to change it, and yes i know it's more work this post was more or less to talk about how shitty it is when this happens for those of use who don't like it as i know i'm not the only one.Right now from what i understand like Anne said it's just completely random so getting the same maps 2 or 3 times in a row actually happens frequently enough that its a noticeable thing.

I don't know how it is setup now but if you were to have a map generator for each server spawning the maps at lets say 80% of the time its normal rotation 18% throwback and 2% of all the other maps that spawn like once a month or whatever the percents are but not have the same map spawn on the same server without 1 or 2 games in between it. So if i play Plasma for 5 minutes and it ends that map can't spawn till another 2 maps have finished. I don't know the mathematics or developing to it as i don't know how that stuff works so maybe i am completely wrong and there actually is no other way of doing this other then how we are now or maybe every other way would be even worse at spawning the maps.you enjoy playing the same maps over and over again?What do you mean by appropriately? Just not the same thing twice in a row?I mean, if this is your definition of bad luck, I'll exchange my luck for yours.If they're good maps, yes.Mispelt is misspelt.

Also thanks Dylz, Azpi and Siz for your efforts commentating :)I can't speak for everyone, but I have been helping out a lot with our design. Our plans to expand to the bottom half are very weak, so it shouldn't be a problem at all. Feel free to stop by our discord:

https://discord.gg/MSdNGDB

and discuss it more there. Chances are it wont be a problem though. Good luck!yea right now we're mostly looking to maintain our current design. If anyone is expanding, it is probably a few rogue users possibly or not possibly related to us.Good luck with the design! We voted down the option to expand south I believe so there are no plans to use that region. If you need help, don't hesitate to hop onto our discord.Also, I don't suppose devs have any stats on number of unique tagpro accounts registered since 1st April? /u/NewCompte /u/ylambda /u/LuckySpammer A bit of context for the non diameter players here, pretty much all of these clips are against the best players in OLTP.

Delete this post asaproger[deleted]Update: it's getting worse, please get on is ASAP Is the tail of the R meant to be a 2x2 block or a line like it is in the picture? IMO, the block looks better, the line is derpy looking.Of course!

The NOPE neck people are invading our "in rainbows" artwork without permsission. We need all the help we can get to push it back. Regards, r/radiohead[deleted]Hey, r/Radiohead checking in. I've been trying to change the lettering back from Fagpro for the past 30 minutes or so. Radiohead logo is also experiencing some grief - I think if we both team up we can get our art back to normal. I love how you can click on the square to see who put it there... could easily lead to a witch huntyep - watching this too, on itFull red! And black behind the r/Radiohead text. Thanks for helping out :) Surprisingly, many of the T -&gt; F have originated from TagPro players. We are fighting ourselves...we need Casual and Competitive gamemodes in my opinion... Nazi mods... Anne Frank will help you? Are you really banned ?

I am looking at recent bans from reports:

1. For a year-old account called "TrashTalk", 3 chat + 5 working against own team reports.
2. A new user got 7 afk kicks + 1 chat report.
3. An unregistered IP got their 5th ban.
4. A year-old account got their 2nd ban.
5. A month-old account got their 3rd ban.

rest are &gt;12 hours old.

EDIT: 3rd guy (the unregistered IP) is actually new and got their 5 bans since March 30th 20:00 my time (One day before /r/place was created actually). I unbanned 

EDIT bis: 3rd guy came at least a day before the /r/place push and says stuff like: 

&gt;im on button duty

&gt;2 o 1 b 1 d is current meta	

&gt;according to a pro i asked	

[deleted]Why could it not be the third guy?Because the third guy got their 5th ban, so has been banned 4 times already, so isn't newlol waterwheel is not good

happy cakeday /u/waterwheel ! :]Wait you play that also? I love that game (obviously not as much as tagpro)Although Im kinda sensing its fake, it does address the real elephant in the room which is using the report system in order to harass someone (false reporting). If someone is caught or proven to false report intentionally (not a mis-click) maybe that should be treated the same as "revenge reporting" is treated (ban)? Some thoughts.Well, I unbanned the 7 afk yesterday and I banned the chat reporter (7 afk guy had only said "gg"), which was his 10th ban, so a 3-month ban.Yea lol I know revenge reports are banned, but I'm saying false reports should also be banned if proven.please enable for origin not radius...as a centra player with 60 ping to origin and 80-100 to radius, I'd love to have competitive and casual separated, but I dont want to stay on radius the whole time.Just don't get /u/McBride36 . He's a real jerk face. Can confirm.

Ask for n00b.  She won't unban you, but you'll get some dank memes.That's how it currently is. revenge reports are a type of false reports, we ban for them.Hey, welcome to the game! Unfortunately that can happen sometimes when you're new (it did to me, a lot). This is usually just due to players being salty when a new player makes a mistake.

What can help is if you change your display name to 'I'm new' or something, people are more likely to go easy on you. (If you're playing as a 'Some Ball' then create an account.)
Of course it shouldn't be this way in the first place, but some people just report too much. I'd like to ask everyone again to really  try and go easier on anyone that might be a new player.Hey bud, I'm a mod of this game, and if you tell me your name I can look into this for you!The game is a delicate balance of wanting everyone to have fun and being super competitive, depending on your personal goals at the time. Attacks on new players is not something we want to happen. I would recommend giving a shoutout at the beginning before play starts letting everyone know you're new. Sometimes there are accounts with low degrees (or Some Balls) that are actually skilled players or trolls and it can be hard to tell even for experienced players.Can we afford to split the userbase more though? Casual would need to be stats off for sure. And what stops a new player from playing in Competitive mode and creating probably an even more hostile situation?You can appeal your ban, I think they would be willing to unban you for this.If you get banned there's a link to a ban appeal i thinkAlso wondering this. This would probably *kill* Diameter. At peak we've got maybe 20 people on normally.These are the people who should actually be banned.

Let me put it this way. Even extremely skilled/relatively friendly players get reported fairly often. Now imagine if you are new and have low skill level...

http://support.koalabeast.com/#/appealYou would need to have x degrees/r300 before you can play in Competitive mode.NewCompte the detective[deleted][deleted]I'm a new player and have been playing a lot today. Not been banned.

Maybe the problem is you mate?To be fair, now that I look at it the third guy actually got their 5 bans after the 30th of March 20:00 my time.

I have unbanned the IP (removed all 5 bans on it).

and says "button duty" at the start of every game.

I'm putting back some bans on him.Spoken like a true casualAnne don't ban me[deleted]75% of mods I know personally are reasonable friendly people. Appeal your ban telling them your concerns. I've done this once and it worked for me.

Most of this community is very friendly and it's unfortunate your first playing experiences were with people who lack this trait.

I recommend you hop on mumble (https://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/wiki/mumble), which really represents our community's true colors &lt;3

We hope you'll come back. 

Yeah, it'd have to only be enabled for Radius at first probably.Similar to when I got a crown as well (also my first month playing). 

But I don't report people very often, maybe twice a month, for actual identifiable offenses. It hurts to get hurt.the reckoning is coming.Ah, I misread it. thought it said report, not ban.This is a good comment. I like you.You probably got very unlucky, some communities people start into are amazing (mine) and some are just real idiots (yours). Don't quit please, Tagpro is amazingThere's a lot of us that play it!Casual would be with visual indicators/timers enabled, r300 stats off, but degrees on.

Competitive would be with visual indicators/timers disabled, r300 stats on, and degrees on too.

There would be casual and competitive games on each server, it's just a different gamemode.

Splitting it into two like this would increase the joiner time, but not by much, especially considering games like CoD and league take 5-10 minutes to even begin.One thing you have to understand about this game is that the players are most triggered overlysensitive people you will ever encounter. The mods are mostly nazi mods and unreasonable. The game continues to lose players every day but the admins and devs continue to employ banhappy nazi mods. 

The moderator Anne Frank is the one helpful and often reasonable moderator. She may be able to help you. 

But as far as playing, getting banned is just a big part of it due to the culture of the game and the mentality of the players. In the future you can try to keep track of your reports and sign off for 24 hours until the reports expire. I don't understand complaints like this. I have been playing tagpro almost constantly for 2.5 years and I have never been banned. Like, you have to be doing something wrong to get the kind of treatment you're suggesting. I bark at players and curse when they don't listen or do stupid stuff and I get like one report a week.How u do dat?Who do you think reported him 8 times? Do you really think it was the "triggered overlysensitive people"? Or do you think it is the mods? Maybe you think it's the devs? Those are the three groups you named in the post. In my experience it's a fourth group you forgot to mention ruining the game, the assholes who only have fun if they are allowed to openly insult anyone they want without being banned.http://support.koalabeast.com/#/appealIow, who got the March crown, which means they probably played the most, got only 7 reports from players in March (plus 4 for being afk too much).[deleted][deleted][deleted]Well he was preatty good in Town Of Salem.everytime we have a push we have these new accounts that say shit like, "sorry guys never coming back."

Some of them are obviously fake, glad you were able to call one out.

also, lol about the new user with 7 afks and one chat....

"hey dude that was my pup, fuck."

BANNED LOL I've never been banned and I've been playing this game for over 2 years. You're definitely doing something wrong Welcome to the game! 

And yeah ignore him there are dicks in every community unfortunately, but for the most part I've found this game is fine especially compared to bigger games like LoLit's because, probably unlike this guy, you're actually good at the game.  only people i ever really report are bad players :/&gt; I'm putting back some bans on him.

NewCompte showing no mercy!One thing I have learned about Tagpro is the ones with hammer &amp; wrench flairs know what they are doing.I wouldn't be surprised if it was the 7 afk guy#buttondutySo what do you do when you live in Cali and get drafted by a northeastern team?well this was the closest ron came to running tryouts

Here Hey, our team have seen your request. We are helping repair another at the moment, but will try to help when and where we can.Acapuck is not our representative :P[deleted][deleted]Edited.You get a DC in your stats and I think it takes longer to join the next game o okayFor slightly more in-depth response, the D/C in your record basically counts as a loss towards your win rate, which hurts your odds of getting win-rate flairs (55%, 65%, 75%).Sword is 55wtfHYPE!!!!

Remember to send in your clips from the games to s12mltptop10@gmail.comWoo![deleted]&gt; Let other users see who is reporting who and if we see it is blatantly false/unfair, we can easily appeal it or report the guy who is reporting people.

The only time you need to appeal false reports is if you are close to or have been banned by the community. People get way too riled up over a single false report, it's ridiculous. Whoever reported you *wants* you to freak out and say "OMG WHO REPORT ME REEEE I WASN'T WAOT". All this would do is increase revenge reports dramatically and start even more arguments about false reports in the middle of a game. 

Personally, I don't think it should ever show when you've been reported, there would be waaaaay fewer time-wasting arguments and people freaking out over a single false report. I've suggested this to the mod team but it doesn't solve everything, and it also creates new issues, so I don't think it'll be implemented. 

Lemme know if any of that doesn't make sense. 

Pls noI realize it may promote a witchhunt mentality, and that people abuse reports all the time, but I think it'll also restrain people from actually reporting in the first place because they know it will be public.

Those people who like starting this type of thing have several times more likely chance of getting completely banned, resulting in less toxicity in the community in general.

I totally understand your concerns thouhgh. I've thought about them myself.why not? :/

If anyone else wants their notes from initial testing, please message me or reply to me here.There was only one and also because[deleted]But wait, that's not your map. It's PongTit's mapI like big maps, and there isn't one in rotation atm. So idk what you are talking about.I think the most important part is just the map area. All of these maps are what I would say are medium-large to really pretty big. Pretty obvious why that leads to longer games I think.

The second one is a characteristic that is often overlooked, and that is having a "backdoor" that an FC can safely buy some time for regrab to get set before they push off trying to cap. A map that is small but has a giant backdoor is Wormy, which is why Wormy games are often very long despite the fact that it is not very big. It is simply that it's very easy to get regrab set before you push off to try and cap. 95% of the time you want to go around the back of Wormy rather than push straight for the centre of the map into danger if you don't have regrab set. I'm not sure if that makes sense, a diagram would make it clear. LMK.

The third and least important part is having too many "islands" in the middle of the map. The problems with these are two fold: the first part is that it's really easy for a FC to hold the flag for way too long just running circles around the islands, using bombs/boosts when needed. I think all of us have sat idly by for 1-2 minutes waiting for the FC to get returned. The second problem with islands is that it's really difficult for 2 defenders to block both sides of the island to shut down the FC. It leads to the predominant method to return being snipes. The competitive map that frustrated me a lot with planning defensive moves was Rush. But there are many more examples of this.

These are my 3 main issues and I believe all of these maps, and a lot of the recent additions (which I have played quite a bit) exhibit one to all of these characteristics. If I was TagPro overlord I would be looking to make games relatively short as much as possible while not making the games a complete tossup, and avoid making games often go to the 10+ minute average.

Anyway, they are just my personal thoughts and feelings.**UPDATE**

~~There was very little thought put into the mid walls on the OG version, admittedly. This gives the walls a bit more purpose, as well as adding an option for entering base.~~

**Gamesphere** by JuicyJuke

[Map](http://unfortunate-maps.jukejuice.com/show/44213)

[Preview](http://unfortunate-maps.jukejuice.com/static/previews/44213.png)

Many changes to the walls (as seen in edit 1). Improved the spacing by expanding in some areas. Moved team boosts so they no longer interfere with double boosts. Added new grabbing mechanism by changing walls in base. Moved some spikes around.

Also wanted to acknowledge that I've changed the name to *Gamesphere*. Okama Gamesphere was [a random South Park reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xddDKtsDw6k) that I thought would be cool and unique. However, it's been brought to my attention that Okama is actually a [derogatory Japanese term for homosexuals and transgenders](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=okama). I'm sorry if I offended anyone and I hope this reaches some of the people that recognized the term when this thread was posted.That's fine, we all have personal opinions on what gameplay should feel like.somewhat similar to aerodent (i wouldn't mind them both being added) but imo this is better.I like the new shape of base and spacing but everything else has gone kind of backwards... the chequerboards will end up with the Fiend-effect of regrab being setup every 5-seconds (making it super regrab-y) and I think the new gates are too easy to bypass. I'm open to changing the gate from what it was before so it's a little fancier but this seems a bit strange to me.GOOD MAP NICE AND SAUCYfinally the best map in all of tagproThis was my favorite map I didn't make that was tested. In a rotation that's begging for a large map to be added, this fits the bill. The implementation of the superboost is flawless, the islands are unique shaped, and it has an all around balanced feel. Change the name, and it has my vote.That superboost is literally asking for people to install timers.best horizontal symmetry map we've had in a long timeUnfortunately, none of these are Market.

All of the non-Market maps seem to suffer from this problem.button placement seems awkward. it's slightly better in the updated version. If you are to include a button in base I would suggest adding a spike to make it less vanilla. Mid bomb is okay but that 45 degree tile is sticking out like a sore thumb. I would  look into adding a boost near the lone 45 degree tile if you plan on keeping it. Right now the map seems like it would be a defensive grind...just my opinion, good luck!We already did.I like the flow of this map. Maybe one pup in base instead of 2, then put 1 right in mid. Super boost is solid on the updated version, not sure on the original, but I didn't have any troubles hitting it right and wasnt spiking myself. Hope this one makes it in...Kraken was never tested.IM HAPPY THAT YOU ASKED!

From the grand book of Sizzzled's rambles...

&gt;gen 1: thread 0-1. pre mtc era, luckyspammer maps. things like speedway, star, glory hole, geok.

&gt;gen 2: thread 1-25. early mtc/mltp era. more deliberate design but still mapmaking is unknown. holy see, boombox, colours are hallmarks of this era.

&gt;gen 3: thread 25-50. regrab becomes commonplace and now balance is a huge focus. pilot, constriction, velocity, smirk, emerald, wormy are born. this is the golden age of mapmaking.

&gt;gen 4: thread 50-75. mapmakers start to learn patterns of what works and what doesn't. this is the formula era. lots of safe pics from mtc but still some outliers. cedar, birch, rush, tehuitzingo encapsulate this era well.

&gt;gen 5: thread 75-. holistic rotation and creative design are becoming important considerations for mtc and mapmakers. notable maps pending. i foresee this gen being a mix between the style and pizzazz of gen3 with the actual design and map knowledge of gen4. expect good things.

/u/3z_ care to add anything?pls test it &lt;3EW no no no no no no fuck that mapRenqr didn't make it to top maps. I'll send you the notes though.[removed]What map is riot?Was great in OLTP, got played in some great playoffs as well.Really? I like everything else but I was just about to comment about the superboost. Constriction has the superboost chain that takes you straight to the flag, but may take too long or not be available. Hurricane has a superboost that takes you straight to the flag but there's a gate and it's also hard to take. IMO a flawless superboost is one that gets you to their flag directly but with a high risk or difficult execution. IMO this one is just a little bit too easy and risk freewe had vagabond but some community decided it wasnt all that great :^)I partially disagree with your convictions. Chasey is a biproduct of size and complex lane structures, yes, but also those things without any form of boosts or bombs which can be used by defenders, which is why, for example, Jardim is chasier than Jagged.

I think this mindset is why postage-size maps are so commonplace now. Big maps can be not-chasey, mapmakers are just too lazy to come up with creative solutions. That's why I'm so strong in favour of Kallypigeon and Aerodent. Big maps, probably fit into your definition of what makes a map chasey, except... these maps aren't chasey.Jardim 2.0. Nothing special about it but it plays fine. Way too cramped imo.This map is both really unique and really good. I haven't ever 4v4ed it but I'd be really excited to see this added.I know the MTC was kinda split on this so if the folks who were against it can come out and tell me what you didn't like, I'd appreciate it a lot.Renqrwut?Update: http://unfortunate-maps.jukejuice.com/show/44092

It's been a wild ride for the yung Map Damon. After appearing in 10 threads over the course of 18 months, he has finally reached his final form. I am hoping y'all vote in Map Damon for what it offers to rotation. In a rotato plagued by maps where variations between size and complexity are indiscernible, Map Damon offers a challenge to pubbers, a reward to vets, and a good time for all. With versatile boost routes all around, mid portals which have never been seen before in rotation, and endless ways to cap, Map Damon will be the new pub stable.

______

Let Map Damon lead us into the 5th Generation of Mapmaking™ and so too shall we follow. Je Suis Map Damon.What vote?What is the 5th Generation of Mapmaking? And how is it defined?it's interesting how the bomb structure was originally like in maap city and now the bombs in the update have moved to the same spot that the bombs in maap city's update didif you switch teamboosts and increase the cooldown it should be just about perfect (for me at least)You made everything obvious and took away most of the charm. It's not what I was trying to make.[what's the problem w/ it?](https://clips.twitch.tv/PerfectVibrantCoyoteOSsloth)Nice! These updates are much nicer.The fact that my time on ball didn't fix my mechanicsWould like to see, thanks. :)I'm new to the whole thing in general, and I think the physics are a little bit unwieldy, especially since there are boost pads and death walls aimed at each other. I'll probably learn, but still.

More impressively aggravating is that there is no delay on flag respawns. Opponents can score and immediately have the flag back in their possession immediately, with our entire team on the other side of the map from chasing after the guy who previously had the flag (don't guard an empty goal, right?). With boosts lined up right they can score again in less than two seconds, before anyone can react. Not cool. &gt; /u/3z_ care to add anything?

As cool as all this is, it only works if MTC recognises that change is needed. Some members are really stubborn about the formula maps (see: PHP, Okama, Headbonk)I think the map has a good skeleton to it, but there are some questionable elements, namely the rather blank corner button (maybe put a bomb feature behind it?), the spike tunnel, and bomb behind the portal. The spike tunnel is atrocious in my eyes, I feel like it should at least be 3 tiles wide but I dont know your intention there. I get that its a 'difficult' boost but it just seems unnecessarily awkward.pls dont make us play thisSolo bbyNot me :(Renqr (I had posted it b4)[Yes](https://www.reddit.com/r/OLTP/comments/5xwi9t/how_did_you_like_aerodent/)same. nothing really popped out as a "wow" or "neat" mapIt''s not too easy, and you combat it kinda the same way as you do off screen boosts on  constriction and smirk. You find where to stand to kill the person who grabs from afar. It's definitely harder to hit than Constriction's, it's easier than Hurricane's, it's faster than both.

What your put there is definitely on my radar as a possible problem though. I glad you said something. hmm get ready for this to be "that Obama map" for all of eternity[Headbonk](http://unfortunate-maps.jukejuice.com/static/previews/42113.png) [- Nym(ph)](http://unfortunate-maps.jukejuice.com/show/42113)It's being published in the results thread.Remix I made of it (not my map though) :) http://unfortunate-maps.jukejuice.com/static/previews/43951.pngThanks!Nice meme[deleted]!devshttp://unfortunate-maps.jukejuice.com/static/previews/43957.png

http://unfortunate-maps.jukejuice.com/static/previews/44055.pngThank you for the feedback! I think you're right, I was hesitating to change the gates at first, and the original form is good as it is. I made them look aesthetically better now, and removed the checkered team tiles. Hey no problem, thanks for listening. I'm mainly thinking of situations where you're using it to get ahead though. For grabbing I don't think it matters so much whether the boost is easy or hard, it won't give you a huge advantage even if you can land it every time. Anyway for getting ahead Constriction has a perfect balance IMO; you have a good chance for a save but they can also be unreachable. Fiend on the other hand is an example of a map where you're almost never truly past 4 (not a superboost but y'know). On this map I don't know, but I may have spoken too soon because I tried it again and spiked a few times or hit a wall.[this one duh](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/63ehzt/blackout_in_rpolitics_about_susan_rice_espionage/), rip /u/skittlekevThose bombs look wayyyyy more fun in mid.

As you can see, hold was about 4 minutes for each team, which is 2/3's of a 6 minute game.  I'd consider that to be a respectable amount of hold, especially when you look further into the eu and see the hold times weren't all that long.  I can't speak for other maps without data, but I'd assume that they were about the same.



fuck the MTCCourse.Yeah. I think PHP is easily the best map of the bunch. I kind of painted them all with the same brush, which was a silly thing to do. PHP is definitely small-medium sized and the islands are protected somewhat with the gates. There's a bit of a backdoor, but it's not as secure as it is on some other maps.lmaoNot feeling most of these. Lets add Fiend.42Boombox-neue. I dig it.

thanks for the input!You are not one of us One of who? Fags on Thom Yorkes dick 24/7I accidentally griefed even though I've been helping the whole time, idk how it happens but sometimes when you click to place it doesn't do what you want it to do, just be careful is all![Lucky Pls](http://imgur.com/JRgg8NA)Click the "Full Place Fullscreen" button then zoom all the way out using your browser (Ctrl+mousewheel, and Ctrl+0 to reset).I've noticed a lot of the FagPro greifers are from within the community.Lots of times, its just that the tile hasn't updated on your screen, but the name of the person who placed the tile does. So sometimes the name you're reading is the one who fixed it.

But you are right, I saw /u/skorchmarks change it to /r/fagpro at least 3 timesI don't know how to respond to this as it's not true at allDeath, taxes, Fagpro.What's the link to view the whole thing? https://youtu.be/A2eU2CG3WN8&gt; As a defender, I know I'm fucked if I start moving around too much and overreacting to a flag carrier's jukes. Once I start moving they can use my momentum against me. As you develop ball control you'll be able to juke better.

This is big. Juking as a flag carrier boils down to your level predictability and mechanics are only a means to reduce the predictability of your movement in the eyes of a defender. Often, when you move tentatively, you can bait a defender to take a swing at you, at which point you can try to move out of the way. Momentary delays in your movement to a certain direction also baits defenders to slam the breaks giving you a chance to break ahead in that same direction. Other than these basics, the only thing that top level players have against you is map experience and route knowledge, which will come with time.Not that I know of.eh i'm sure they get the jist from the write up anyway, just thought in case you knew of an archive with something related in it would be handy to link!Hey man, here's a comment I wrote in a previous thread about this, the first point is probably the one that's going to make things 'click' the most, and the others are more general movement tips:

&gt; The four biggest tips I can give to you are as follows:

&gt; 1: Two sets of controls; Up/Down and Left/Right

&gt; OK so one of the quirks of TagPro's movements is that the Left/Right and Up/Down controls function completely independently of one another. What this means is that while in most games you go 'right' slower if you were going 'up + right' as opposed to just 'right' (like the movement of a joystick), in TagPro if you were moving 'right' at full-speed and started pressing 'up', you wouldn't slow down going right. This is a little counter-intuitive at first but actual opens up so much in terms of the kind of jukes you can move and the way you cut corners. Once you start seeing the game's controls as two separate sets of controls, it'll really help you understand movement.

&gt; 2: Corners and walls

&gt; So you've noticed how slowly you accelerate and decelerate, right? Well you can actually use the environment (specifically corners and walls) to change directions much faster than you would otherwise. For example: if you needed to do a 180 degree turn, it might be faster to run into a nearby wall and bounce off it rather than slow all the way down to a halt and start up again. Secondly, clipping the corners of blocks can very quickly change your direction without taking much of your momentum away from you.

&gt; 3: Not moving at full speed (unless you need to)

&gt; Pretty simple. The faster you're going, the slower it is to decelerate. If you're moving at about ~1/2 speed, you're in a nice sweet-spot where you can accelerate or decelerate quicker than you would be able to otherwise. A few things to note: remember point #1 --&gt; you have two sets of controls that work independently of each other! You can be moving at full-speed in one (say, up/down) and not at all in the other (right/left), making it much easier to change your right/left momentum than your up/down momentum. Secondly, this is DEFINITELY not saying to not move at full-speed, just that if you're less confident then this isn't a bad idea, but as you get more confident situationally then you'll be more aware of when you can/should be moving at full-speed.

&gt; 4: Positioning

&gt; This isn't really a point about movement so much as the limitations of it and how to get around it: no matter how good you are, your ball is still pretty sluggish and you can sometimes realise you've over-committed about a second or two before you 'actually' get juked - you can minimise the effects of movement by learning how best to position your ball at any given moment. This isn't really a point I can make briefly because it's such a huge part of the experience you pick up whilst playing, just letting you know that a lot of what seems like superior movement is just better positioning that you too will learn in time.

&gt; Best of luck to you - if you need any of what I've said explained further (I know I can waffle a bit), please let me know.

If any of this isn't clear or you need anything explaining better, let me know.

To answer your question about bouncing off walls: if you 'turn' right as you hit the wall you'll manage to change direction best.Going Diagonal (UP + RIGHT for example) is faster than just going right.I don't think there's a shortcut to mastering control out there but here are some things to think about:

- Keep your hand relaxed and light on the keys (not everyone does this but I had to start at some point because my arm was starting to hurt and I realized mashing the keys was doing more harm than good.)
- Don't move at top speed unless you need to get somewhere fast. The slower you're moving, the easier it is to change directions.
- You can use a wall to instantly kill your momentum. This can be useful to set up a boost or deceive a defender. I think when you reach a certain level of ability this will come naturally to you.
- With juking, remember that the overall goal is to deceive the defender, and that there are ways to do that that don't involve juking. *Worry less about juking at this point and focus on understanding the overall strategy of the game*. As a defender, I know I'm fucked if I start moving around too much and overreacting to a flag carrier's jukes. Once I start moving they can use my momentum against me. As you develop ball control you'll be able to juke better.Aling with the above comments, there is also ball spin. Pay attention to which way the ball is spinning as it will affect how you bounce off walls. Hey Berlin, really nice write up, do you know does anyone have any video explaining these concepts though? I feel new players could really do with visual aid, maybe even a picture of arrow keys and what's being pressed as the video explainsOne picture I do like that helps emphasize the way your acceleration works was a picture of your ball with a circle for normalized movement vs a square which shows emphasis on moving diagonally. I could make a cover. Would just have to pay 7¢ everytime it was played. Have we officially become allies with Radiohead? We defend them they defend us?Copyright surely?[deleted]"Fake Plastic Map" - that should get in by the title alone.Rename Bigmouth?Maybe a map could be named with a reference to Radiohead? If the map creator wants to of course.True.

I bet someone could cover one of their songs in a much more tagpro-like fashion being only instrumental and really upbeat though.

that would be d0pe afI mean my map titles almost always reference music but my maps are also mostly badYup. This is why all of TP's music is made by the community.[deleted]There  are a ton of Radiohead instrumentals. I suggest TreefingersYes, I made talks with their mod early on and let them know we had no intentions of encroaching. We called a truce. 

I helped them fill a lot of their background when it was blue, too. I would bet they helped us too. A beautiful thing it was. Thanks!Thata's a good one, but the harder boost is taking the boost under the one that you took, and going to through the same spot!

Still incredible you hit it in game though, I've done it once or twice in a maptest after about 100 triesYes, and it was all definitely, 100%, without a shred of doubt, intentional.😂LMAO i'm done did you just link a picture of an emojiare you a new player from r/place too? Change your name in the sidebar so we know who you are!Our discord is located here:

But the short answer, is no. We have been around since the first few hours, and we are not going to give up our space. If you want to go under the rainbow feel free. but you are not going to come over the rainbowI think we generally like the flat blue because it sticks out more in the massive field of multicolours and patterns.

Really appreciate you guys coming and asking if it was ok, that's highly honourable. I will gladly help defend y'all if I see anything come close. Especially on Origin of Symmetry, because reasons.[deleted]Only if you donate firstJoint effort for that portion!Ah, understandable. Well, carry on with your monument. I think the blue background would look better if it had some patterns! Cheers.fuck offhttp://c1.thejournal.ie/media/2015/10/face-with-tears-of-joy-752x501.png

nice![deleted]Didn't know you guys owned the rainbow. Assumed it was from /r/ainbowroad?LMAO i'm done did you just link a picture of an emojiYou've been reported! Sometimes, reports are false. You can ignore these, until you get 8 and then it's going to be a hassle.Might be a good one to talk about with the devs. /u/PrivateMajor Thanks BetterBrunette!That sounds great! I wish there was a way for some balls to deal with 8 reports, although that dissolves into a critique of the report system in general.I keep the special ones in the back...http://i.imgur.com/ddouzSV.jpg

Something like this [deleted]Mind If I attempt to construct a black triangle with a purple dot in the middle down at the bottom of your blue area?Sorry squash, I don't think we'd be too amenable to that, we're trying to keep our area secure. Does the design have some significance? Maybe we can help you find somewhere else to put itI'm only interested in 4 dash pitchforks Man, I've got plenty in me already, I think I'll pass!I'll be honest, I'm not quite sure what area you mean. Can you clarify?You'd want to talk to the actual /r/tagpro for that. I'm not representative of them -- merely a diplomat from another faction here to solve a crisis.

That said, I don't think they'll be too willing. Feel free to ask if you want, but don't say I didn't warn you!Does the fact that Anne Frank sells pitchforks raise any eyebrows?Ah, mb. Not acquainted with all the merchants of Tagpro quite yet.The problem is solved, who wants to buy back these pitchforks I had ready?

Void hasn't touched RIT hopefully they leave us alone too. I have work so I can't help too much.the /r/tagpro - /r/radiohead coalition will prevailHOLD THE LINE!LOVE ISN'T ALWAYS ON TIME!I'm able to switch over to this from time to time throughout the day. Can you give me an update on what I should be lookin' out for? Basically the stuff is all done/made and now we're just trying to keep ours and Radiohead's the same? Yup. I believe we are just in maintain mode until this is over. We dont really need to expand (maybe can't anyways). I think we have a pretty awesome piece.

Hope to pub with you soon, it's been a whileAnd we got yours as well.Your ad looks a lot better now. Nice.Is the thing directly to our top left supposed to be an /r/oltp logo? I've been maintaining what I've thought it should look like to try to stop the void spread from there.Call up the Reservists! will try and help when there aren't people in the meeting room behind meWe got your back at /r/radiohead[You're welcome](http://i.imgur.com/ILw3C7I.png) we should have a radiohead flair to recognize their contribution to the tagpro emblem on r/placeGreat job this entire weekend everyone! We stood our ground and made some valuable allies defending our space. It was really cool to see everyone come together in discord to protect the TP emblem. Good times with all of you!Our lord and saviouryour welcome , thanks for helping us tooWe lost Lebron though, grim.Special shoutout to /u/psychfan5 /u/acapuck, you guys put in so much effort and used democratic decision making practices being extremely open to counter arguments. Excellent leadership :)

Edit: Also @devs I think they're deserving of a community contributor flair&gt; Also, shout-out to /r/radiohead for being dope neighbours!

Yeah, I really want to see some kinda nod to them in our subreddit sidebar or something as a thanks. They offered sister-subreddits and that sounds cool. They're gr8, esp when the void was getting close at the end.Anyone inclined to make a Radiohead themed texture pack?Lol I argued about this on discord so much. Light works that way, not symmetrically :pi hear if you guilt trip /u/kintaro08 hard enough he might one day revive it when all the stars align perfectlyYes, I too, definitely think they deserve community contributor flair. They were constantly vigil and did well to incorporate mine and many other ideas into the design in a fair and democratic way, plus negotiated intensely with neighbors and factions ensuring that our logo remained untouched and looking sharp. 

I won't forget the coordinated effort it took to shift and expand the balls. Great times.I'm from /r/radiohead and I was happy to help keep your boarders safe.  We all really appreciated the help you guys gave us too!  :)Honestly, that was the most annoying part and I probably spent 50 percent of my pixels during these three days reverting this. Why would you cause such sabotage to a great community?lol u mad broUnderrated comment right here[deleted]haha ya ur right i am very bad ass[mfw](https://youtu.be/mLC9XgOvHjM?t=66)
GG guys!

Had a lot of fun in the discord chat while defending this logo, I'm glad our hard work paid off and we managed to stay as TagPro and not FagPro!

Also, fuck RITHoly shit, when I went to bed the void was nowhere to be found. Looks like they came on strong in the end!Great job this weekend Eld. Good times working with ya!Yeah looks like they were finally able to move the portal? As I went to bed last night I wasn't sure what would happen. Thanks for defending the TP space!Yeah that was fun. It's been a while since I've hopped on something like mumble or discord with the tag crew. Had a little nostalgia working on a tagpro project.

Also, I wouldn't mind getting a community contributor flair again. I miss my old one.  
:(They only moved the portal by using a bot to move the entire project. We tried to fight it but it was too much.Anyone got a link to how many times those T/F pixels were changed?  "Oh, I'll update over here...and I have to fix the T again..."  It has to be a large amount.yeah f uCorrect.As someone with a PhD in letter vandalization, it makes perfect sense.This is a top 5 moment of my life.Wow the entire thing is completely clean too (the two R's are different but that's super minor)

It was getting attacked hard this morning so that's great to seeI was just about to fix that R when it ended, too. Still, better than expected!Good job to everyone who kept at it! I'm happy to have been a part of this and am quite frankly glad it's over. Hopping on at 3am-4am to clean up griefers was not going to keep up for long, and seeing the void growing nearby was disconcerting as well.

Also, shout-out to /r/radiohead for being dope neighbours!Yup!yep, something told me that's what I needed to do with  my time this morning lolGlad it's over and we survived, that was an intense fight against The Void at the end.

We repelled so many invaders over the 3 days, crazyYou guys were the best neighbors we could've had. Glad to help ya'll and thanks for helping us :)It was cool to see two communities I appreciate interact with each other by chance.Anyone have the final numbers for the /r/Place Push?No one will ever take away you being one of the OG Nightcap crew homieI don't know for sure, but I'm assuming it's because the hypothetical light source is only coming from one direction.  Same reason the highlights are both on the left of the balls.so proud of this community! [deleted]"Where's Waldo?"

"Son there's something I have to tell you..."I changed it to fagpro about 20 times, huehue. RIP fagproA "T" for the upvote and "F" for the downvote lolI think those numbers are low. 

The link you shared shows 211 for April 1 and 45 yesterday.

Additionally, Reddit itself says even higher numbers: https://www.reddit.com/r/tagpro/about/traffic

303 on the 1st and 83 yesterday. Which one are talking about cause I kept making it look like the one on the left.Because he's 13.It was our pleasure! Couldn't ask for better neighbor. It was a ton of fun.What part doesnt make sense hahaI miss nightcap.  That shit was funny as fuck.Great meeting you man, shame the slime didn't make it to the end but I'm glad you had fun all the while!Yeah with as much as it got changed, it felt like it was basically a coin flip whether that 'T' would end up an 'F' or not.Can we get the Radiohead+Tagpro logos as the new downvote icon on this sub?lol is that an OLTP sign above and to the left?Ive been fighting to preserve the integrity all morning! glad it paid off Yeah we were trying to do OLTP/ELTP/MLTP but the void kinda stopped us in our tracks at the end...Anne doing a good job? No, no that isn't right.ffs Renegade, stop ruining tagproThanks for trying to defend the Slime. It was an awesome experience working with you guys during the experiment!Seriously genius idea here

pls mods[123 new subscribers on April 1, 45 new subscribers yesterday](http://redditmetrics.com/r/TagPro)Same. Someone (you know who you are) kept changing it back. :-(I'm not a tagpro-er, but I have to say, yours was one of the top few creations that I noticed for quality and consistency.  You guys and the GNU/Linux penguin.  

And Darth Plagueis, I guess, but r/starwars has so many users it hardly even counts.

EDIT: Oh, I guess that was r/prequelmemes.  Still, I'm sure r/starwars helped out.[deleted]Don't you fucking dare do it without meChrono Trigger is fucking BAE.At the very least every April 1st to remember this moment.of course bby

I'm SO GLAD it's over. This was starting to consume my life!!!

Thank you guys for believing in the vision. It took all of us to make this happen.Huge shoutout to these guys. We had some serious leadership from them this weekend that should be praised. Great job holding it down![Not a huge change but its something](http://i.imgur.com/t9R3dKg.png)Also /u/no_sissies_allowed 

He acted as an ambassador the first day, and made sure we had peace with our neighbors.

Acapuck 100% deserves that flair, I was very active the first day and stayed up until like 6 am helping maintain as well as build, but he did it every day and night. That dude was insane.Figures you can count on /r/tagpro for scripting skillsthat void was super duper close. nothing of value was damaged in the end./r/place had built in timers so I had no need for scripts thereExcept for waldo :([deleted]Tell druks or pigoon to hit me up on Facebook earlier that day/day before when that happens and I'll join in on it. Get the quad squad back in for one more night cap. This was where I spent most of my time at /r/place because am from /r/radiohead and I've never heard of tagpro. I legit thought it was supposed to be fagpro. But I'm glad ours didn't end with Badiohead&gt;"I won't forget the coordinated effort it took to shift [...] the balls"

Teamwork makes dreamworkThat would be sickI tried to turn a flag yellow but it never made it past 3 pixels Nice!  Good to hear!You know, I would guess at least half the uniques and pageviews from March 31, and most of the subscriptions, were due to /r/place as well—all the times on the reddit traffic page are in UTC, and /r/place started well before midnight of March 31 UTC.The one on the left does look slightly better, but the reason most of us kept it looking like the one on the right, is because it is easier to defend. The right R takes two pixels instead of one to turn into an A or B, and that made it far less susceptible to griefers and trolls.Wait, would that mean that if it was purple, then changed back and forth, say, 10 times, and then was still purple at the next snapshot, the model wouldn't register any change?I'm a mod and willing to help. What is your in game name?get the ban ini'd argue this was not a leak but strategic dissemination of informationoof leaking mod slackAppreciate the shoutout man, we had a great thing going!

Couldn't have done it without everyone here.glad to know all my attempts at bringing 
traffic to r/fagpro helped in the endCan I just tag on a special shout-out to Chuck_Finley, Ballkenende, ^^^^^myself, Irish_Jesus and whoever else was there on the ELTP group.me at the very beginning to get this started?This is also true, I first found out about this after Ballkenede posted on the /r/tagproirl group me. Thanks to all the Euros for starting this!

edited!#**Special Shoutouts:**

**Acapuck-** This dude did not fucking sleep. I stayed awake the first night until like 6am, but this guy seemed to be on day and night, constantly organizing plans and keeping everything intact.

**D8-** Early on he would go to every sub around us and make sure that we had peace. He also ran the spreadsheet for a long time that held our designs and ideas.

**Some Ball -1-** He created a script to keep our log intact for as long as possible.

**Satan-** He modified the script and made it focus only on the letters so that the most important thing would be preserved. I know a lot of people, including myself, just left this script running overnight to prevent /r/fagpro.

**Zagd-** He seemed to always be on and had about 10 accounts running to fix anything before it got out of hand.

**The Euros-** There were a group of Euros who had the idea at first to start this, Chuck_Finley, Ballkenende, Berlin Ball, Irish_Jesus. ~~(Even though chuck just went to bed and did none of the work)~~ Wouldn't have been possible without them.

**BusinessBird-** The hero we needed, but didn't deserve

**Everyone who was on discord with us-** Discord was so much fun with everyone, when we were getting attacked, talking to other subs and other artists making their logos. We stood together and made it though the entire event with our logo intact. Thanks everyone

**Pretty much everyone else-** This event was insanely fun for everyone, I have never seen tagpro come together like this for anything before, so thank you for helping, even if you  didn't do as much as some others, every single tile helped.&gt;I personally would not have called the shape a square but cool fact!

It's two halves of a square, silly! &gt; area of TagPro was roughly 216*216

I personally would not have called the shape a square but cool fact!This guy maths!The map was 1250x1250 tiles = 1,562,500 tiles exactly. So take 2,734/1,562,500 = 0.174976%No, it was 1000x1000. I just checked again to be sure.funny how you can make an equilateral right triangle out of pixelsI was confused because you're comparing resolution instead of pixels, which is what I expected.

Anyway, this map had 1 million pixels. I'll count up the pixels for each to give us an exact answer.

EDIT 1: with a margin of error of ~100 pixels, **we placed 2,734 pixels, or 0.2734% of all pixels.**

EDIT 2: Here are some statistics for the pixels we placed. These do not necessarily add up to 2,734, and I may be off by a little.

* In the OLTP banner, we placed exactly 200 pixels.

* In the TagPro nameplate, we placed 496 pixels.

* In the TagPro letters, we placed 162 pixels.

* In the rainbow road to the right, we placed 539 pixels.

* In each power-up, we placed 137 pixels.

* In the three power-ups, we placed 411 pixels.

* In each ball, we placed 43 pixels.

* In each flag, we placed 33 pixels.

* In the two balls and flags, we placed 152 pixels.Damn, my estimate got pretty close (with 0.2916%)! Thanks for the additional stats `:-)`Sure thing. I don't know if you counted OLTP or the right rainbow border; if not you were a bit high.I did count part of the right border in my mental math (since we contributed a lot to it). That explains it!Including only the dark blue squares and all the squares within the blue, i.e. logo, balls, flags pups: **2510 or 0.2510%**

- Logo/nameplate: 412

- Purple TagPro letters: 164

- RR to the right: 580

- 3 pups: 411

- Balls w/ flags: 170[deleted]A long time ago, I got logged out and forgot my login. Anything I can do about that? I have no friends :(. Does somebody want to add me?Wow, besides the corners and the center we were second most contestedSure showed themHow close is it to being the most contested tile?/r/AskReddit mods were persistent. We could definitely extend the push with this kind of content. Especially if we're one of the top ~10 contested tiles.http://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/63473e/the_war_of_the_osu_sign_shown_in_3d_by_stacking/dfr7rulHell yeah

My sweat and blood was poured into that skyscraper.Isn't the data available on the Minecraft environment? Can't quite tell if we are tallest or not from just the static picture.

Can someone with Minecraft do some digging?Block data puts us at 205 tall. 

I would take that with a grain of salt however, because we were flipping awfully fast. If the server only takes snapshots every 5 minutes, for example, it wouldn't record every single flip. This is why we need the raw data from the admins.

For comparison, the minecraft model says one arbitrary pixel in the dota2 logo flipped 256 times, but I'm pretty sure our T flipped more than that.Very good point! Ours flipped way more than once every 5 minutes on averagePretty sure that tile is 237, 461.  It was near the top of this list at this point:

https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/63240q/rplace_activity_animated_heatmap/dfr6g1w/

and was probably contested by scripts for the remainder of the time.Where did you find this?No clue. Hopefully the mods will release pixel data for us to sort through.[deleted]https://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/wiki/modding#wiki_chat.2Fmacro_scriptsUse [this link](http://watball.github.io/chat-macros/). Works perfectly, super easy to use.At least they didn't call it the fag game.2stronk4uFor some reason this makes me feel so good.Brilliant.I don't see how it could have gone any better!!We got in right at the start and had a great location.

We deployed the most efficient shape - a triangle - to give us the least borders to defend.

We built to a decent size that was readily visible, yet not an eyesore; required effort but still maintainable.

We were bordered on two sides by the rainbow road, which was a staple of the overall structure, and developed a strong alliance with our only other neighbour.

We were an easy target for people to screw with internally through graffiti, but remained impregnable to actual intruding forces.

And we held our ground from the dawn of battle until the final pixel was fired.

Ladies and gentlemen, this title is deserved.Also, check out the void calling us the strongest on the map along with the Rainbow: https://www.reddit.com/r/theblackvoid/comments/62s0h2/flank_your_enemies_do_not_attack_directly_expand/

&gt;Take the path of least resistance. That is the nature of the void, and why I the tendrils are shaped as they are.

&gt;The EU, The LIGHT, and Country flags (along with the tag game (probably the strongest along with the rainbow)) are mountains.

Lol the name is literally right there and they still call it thatWe made it into the history books!!!I stopped playing tagpro for the most part a while back, but still helped out on /r/place like 10x. I still love you guys.

I wasn't about to let that T get turned into an F on my watch.Tag Game!!!Also fun fact: we originally built down the rainbow to give us their protection, but the right side of our rainbow road border was built by us, not them. We pretended they built it to maintain our borders.I was one of the leaders making the call on the expansion down rainbow road to create a triangle, but the idea to border us with a second rainbow road was conceived after I went to bed. It was truly brilliant, and a great example of how we as a community came together to make great decisions and build on those great decisions.little do they know we had only 30 people max defending it. i kept spamming their discord with the coordes but they chose to focus instead on invading stupid indiawow ur so cool frocena its this sunday ask baz[deleted]hmm old meme 

Hey all, just signed up, is there anything I should do now? :)The last FA period is in like 3 weeks or somethingYou'll have to wait a week or 2, but you'll get onto a team and the captain of the team will contact you on reddit :)[deleted]what is loveOLTP playoffs r ovaNew phone who disOld meme. Typical of you though

Hmm colon thinking colon ELTP draft was Sunday and Monday. ENLTP draft is Wednesday, and I believe free agency signups open after that. However, a message to /r/eltpseason9 *may* get you into tomorrow's draft without having to go through free agency ([source](https://redd.it/63edyu)), so if you are interested that is your best bet.When is the deadline for Free agent signups?
funny ._.http://i.imgur.com/iAujOTo.gifvOf all the people I've met during my time playing TagPro, you're definitely one of, if not *the* person I'm most glad to have met. Thank you for everything you did for me during my lowest times last year - you're a real friend. 

I know we'll keep in touch, I just wanted to put this post here so everyone knows what a genuinely nice guy you are, which I'm sure anyone who's spoke to you already knows.Honestly one of the nicest, most genuine guys I've had the fortune to meet in my time playing this game. Toasties, gravity maps, pupas and pubs - always a great laugh and quality company. It's a shame for me and for so many others in the community that you're quitting, but massive respect for doing what you thinks best for you, and wish you all the best going forwards.

Have a good Christmas!Fun playing with you, sam! Only wish you the best of luck in the real world! &lt;3 ggSam :'(gl manSame to you bud. Meeting you in Amsterdam was an absolute pleasure you're such a good lad to hang around with. I was incredibly skeptical about going to a meetup but you and the others definitely made it worth it. You're hilarious to play with too, all the best :)You come across so damn nice BALLDON'TLIE, I hope you can get yourself that well deserved Superball!I'm glad you've got yourself involved again with the community Huck you're such a good laugh. All the best with ELTP and I hope you're feeling better soon with the old ankle. Fuck I'm going to miss you mP. I feel like we get on so well I wish we could have spent more time together after Season 7. Please keep in touch and all the best &lt;3See you around Chris, always had a lot of respect for you man. All the best.I enjoyed our short stint together on a team, all the best Tuned!You too super, always a funny guy to play with. Best of luck out there to bud &lt;3Goodbye Sam! You are a very nice and honest young man, I hope you are successful wherever you go! Best of luck! ❤❤😘See you next week, Sam

Good luck with uni and life, and we might meet once again. 
(Always up for a drink if you are ever back in Amsterdam)
Feels really weird to see you quit. With you going and Sherra not playing eltp this season, an era finds its end. Like /u/Odrevan some of my fondest memory are of the BDN team back in S5 I think it was. Tagpro and eltp is losing a great player, community contributor, and person. 

I wish you the best and hope to see you back soon :)Thanks ruff, so glad I got to interact with you more recently. You're a real top guy and will do a fantastic job captaining this season, all the best &lt;3I love you big man, all the best, keep in touch &lt;3Electroball the Neutral Flag Wizard. You used to make me laugh so much back in Season 5. Feels weird it was more than a year ago! I hope to see you around in pubs from time to time, all the best &lt;3&lt;3 Sam.Thanks for all the work you put into the community, and best of luck with whatever you choose to fill your time with instead (might I suggest crocheting).[deleted]It was comin' sooner or later, huh?

Huge loss for the community and ELTP. But sincerely hope you have a great life outside of TP. Best of luck with everything.Later Uncle Keith &lt;3Seeya lad, fun playing with you, ECLTP was fun, thanks for organizing!&lt;3It's more so about stepping away from the community than the game, you'll see me around don't worry :)See you Ballk, a lot of respect for how much you've grown as a person these past few years, keep at it &lt;3Aw man. Sad to see you go, will miss you. Had some great times in tagpro and irl, awesome meeting you. All the best. &lt;3You too wub, all the best &lt;3Love you, Sam. 

I'm posting that video tonight. You said I could when you left. This is one of the first quitting posts where I recognise the player's name, sad times for Chord :(Cheers Roberto, you're honestly one of the most talented people I've ever met! All the best.Really enjoyed all the time we spent on a team together especially watching you grow as a player. You're a really great guy inter, all the best with this season :)Thank you Sam for everything you've done for the community, you're a genuine star. I hope you pop on Mumble every once in a while, all the best :)Our interactions were always a pleasure, Sam. Wish you the best of luck IRL!It's not gonna be the same without you buddy!

 I remember you were the one who convinced me to sign up for eltp for the first time back in 2015 and so I owe you a huge thanks for introducing me to this community, which has been a big part of my life for the past 2 years. It was always great fun playing with and against you, and just hanging out in mumble, I really hope that you pop back every now and then to keep in touch.

All the best mate :)Probably the biggest possible loss to ELTP right now but you've done so much for everyone here that it's definitely a well deserved break. 

Thanks for the best season ever, the countless hours of fun I've had playing with and against you and for always being happy to help me out, even with stuff outside of the game.

Good for you for moving on. Hope you'll find even more success in other stuff than you've had in TagPro!

Will miss you, burger boy :)You too Juker, you're a very funny lad. Best of luck getting into uni, keep in touch xIt's great to see you improving buddy! Sorry I couldn't help more, all the best :)I'll miss you Frocey Best of luck too budYou're a fucking don at TagPro, it's a shame about your connection. We've definitely missed you on mumble TBM.

All the best with the future &lt;3the best partner I could have asked for coming into the competitive scene from pubs, honestly. I swear we had a telepathic connection or some shit lol, I've never played with anyone else who could understand what I was trying to do better than you could. Good luck sam, thanks for all the fun timesI'm late to the party  but thank you Sam for all your great contributions to ELTP and the community. I won't forget meeting you, how you introduced me to moderatorship and all the other great moments in and outside of tagpro. I wish you all the best in the future, and hope you enjoy your retirement :)I'm glad to hear that Risk. Had so much fun in Season 8, definitely my favourite season in MLTP. Still so salty about that playoff game :(

All the best for the future bud &lt;3It was incredible meeting you and all the others in Amsterdam, such an amazing experience!

im done looking at pixelsFIf you're really into it there is the start of something just up and to the right of the Van Gogh https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p0DAz_30qQnope.http://pxls.space/ is more similar to place but can still have bots probablybut the words you type are made of pixels O_O[deleted]I noticed that, it's pretty cool that we were the first to make our mark on Place. While everyone else was still focused on dickbuts, we were there. Take a look at this timelapse vid, we're up basically immediately.

This is just a post I wanted to make about the evolution of our little place on place :)*air quotation marks*The song is Double Bass by Gorillaz!Noiiiice man! Get rekt noogs Ayyyy thanks!music? this is awesomeThank you muchSo for a year from May 2014-March 2015 I was living in a place where I couldn't get reliable internet so I didn't play much. I started playing Thanksgiving of 2012 so a year off was tough. It was in that year the notion of Re really developed so when I came back and people were camping and calling it re I was like..... oh shit things have changed.he was probably playing before people cared so much about ReOh, we cared, but we called it camping, and it was frowned upon.  
Exact same with me :Dyep i rememberso happy to hear that!! maybe I'll see you in-game :) 

let me know if you have any questions!Glad to have you back.Not op but I'm here for this first time from place. 

What is itIt's a browser based capture the flag game! Red vs Blue. There are 3 power ups that give you special powers for 20 seconds (the green things on the map) and boosts that propel you in the direction you're going (the arrow things on the map). The games are played to 3 captures or 12 minutes, whichever happens first. Go to http://tagpro.gg and select a server close to you with a lot of players! :)Good to hear your return. I'd love to hear what you think are some of the biggest changes you see. Welcome back elad04! :)OH MY GOSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHThat fucking carnage.rekt[mfw i see you hit that button](http://imgur.com/gallery/0w5UAMX)Why do video games have to be so violent?[also i want u to know you are a man after mine own heart with this play!](https://streamable.com/olv7)Mr. Kelly, you said that the defendant threatened that if you didn't, and I quote, "Stick things up your butt, he would rape your butt until the room stinks, and then he would eat your butt and his son's butt until his stomach was... full of butt."wew Dirty[deleted]Oof, my very first userscript :) brings a tear to this old ball's eye


i love bash btw. shell scripting and R scripting take up about 90% of my work timeCould just open another tab and go to your player profile.

Nice job.FriendsThis is absolutely fantastic. You legitimately have me laughing out loud in my office.montrealhttp://unfortunate-maps.jukejuice.com/

This is the repository for all maps that have been created for TagPro. There are some practice versions of maps, but they aren't very well organized so they'll be tough to find. Searching for the map you're looking for would be the best way to go about it. 

There are also servers specifically for testing maps: 

http://maptest.newcompte.fr/ Paris server

http://maptest2.newcompte.fr/ Montreal server

You can make a group in there and then roll around on any map in rotation (plus many more) for as long as you like. You can also test any map from http://unfortunate-maps.jukejuice.com/ by taking the number ID off the end of any map's URL. 

Really all you need is http://unfortunate-maps.jukejuice.com/ lol but yeah. What server is the best for a low ping radius player to test on? What does the ping look like?thanks joshHead over to one of NewCompte's servers:

* [Paris, France](http://maptest.newcompte.fr/groups/create/)
* [Montreal, Canada](http://maptest2.newcompte.fr/groups/create/)
* [Sydney, Australia](http://oceanic.newcompte.fr/groups/create/)

Make a private group with just yourself in it, and you can set up your game however you want. I like to max out the time and set re-spawns to 0 for pops, boosts and bombs. I used to do this to practice certain boost routes.People mainly use this extension for chat macros but it also saves the chat if you want so you can scroll up in it (kinda buggy sometimes): https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tagpro-chat-enhancer/bffcbhifhdeaaialpegkdakkfjalofom?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialogChrysalis wasn't redeemed.

Then again, those posts three are from the same person, and are heavily downvoted, soo... [deleted]The hate is mostly coming from one person.I think most people have calmed down on the Anti-Brony front. I remember back when we used to hit r/all more frequently I'd see people in the comments saying they weren't bronies but they enjoyed the art that came out of this community. It's one of the reasons I voted to stay on r/all when we had that vote awhile back. I like to think the major players out there will respect and appreciate our art and help preserve it. Blue corner is heavily supported by /r/Europe because you know, Flag of Europe is mostly blue xDBut ponies are also controversial among the general public. I dunno.[](/rdcry) Doesn't seem to be working, I filled in a bunch of pink when the counter wasn't on and it's been all scribbled on again. Perhaps we should refocus on the sleeping heart Dashie?Yeah, at this stage it's looking like it might be more useful to focus on preserving and bordering the finished dash art, what with the blue-tentacle-spaghetti-coming-out-of-the-eyes thing.

[(774, 425)](https://www.reddit.com/r/place#x=773&amp;y=427)However, outlining something in blue is apparently a decent way to make it get preserved instead of bulldozed.

Looks like you beat me to it too.It's pretty much entirely destroyed. D: 

Luckily, Rainbow Dash is finished, and has only minor occasional damage. Come help defend it!It glitches out sometimes, the timer was not actually ever turned off. It did to me as well. Unfortunately, when that happens your clicks aren't registered. Ah, ok. That makes sense, I figured it was just a function of the current level of activity, and for a few minutes it was just really calm. Thanks for explaining that! :) /) (\\ No problem man!

It seemed to overload the servers pretty good, so I think they made it 10 minutes to reduce the load. It seems like they didn't change the timer after you place a pixel, so it will show 5 minutes instead of the actual 10 minutes.[](/twiponder)It's already been a bit, er...  
[...let's say, defiled?](http://i.imgur.com/kEzIMw6.png)[](/scootacheer) I'll do my part!Madness?

[](/flutterbrow)Εδώ είναι Σπάρτη μαντάμ, και σε όποιον αρεσει.

This is Sparta madam, and to whoever likes it.[](/cheerilee) Such is the internet.*adds a red pixel to the mane*

Well see you guys in 10 minutes.[](/derpysalute) I'm doing my part![Sensible chuckle](https://i.imgur.com/9sxHPBx.jpg)Ditto, getting started on the top right.[deleted][](/ajangry) It seems to be getting attacked. I'm in. We must defend Pinkie!Yep! Berrytube's trying to finish it up. Help would be appreciated!I've slapped down a few pixels myself [](/09)I'm so sorry I laughed my ass off when I clicked on it because it's being completely destroyedI'm not sure yet whether the timer will continue to increase, or if it will eventually shift back down.

Good on you for counteracting the vandalism![](/ppboring) This is so much awesome!

[](/sp)

[](/ajcry) Also RIP Pinkie, you weren't with us long enough!

[](/sp)

[](/happyluna) Also, pixel placements are now limited to once every 20 minutes. Wow!Hopefully since she's finished the big groups will recognize her as art and giver her protected status (as they did with Lord Helix). I'd say rainbow road is the best bet, since they've allowed Helix to stay complete while blue has already destroyed Pinkie Pie. Plus, RD is within their theme.I am currently outlining her in black, could use some help.
It seems to be limited to about 50 per second, so the more people there are, the longer everyone has to wait.[](/twismile) Discord. [](/rarityannoyed) And no one thought to inform the rest of us plebes?[](/rpinkieawe)

[](/rppreally) Fine, but since we had to ask first, don't expect a birthday card from me this year.Well thats what this thread is for! Spread the word![](/rarityprimp) I wasn't anyways. [](/joy) Yes! I was just about to make a post about this. :D I'm working on the Pinkie Pie in the corner above blue. It looks like blue is respecting it too, as they are making an outline around it. I was afraid they would ruin it noooo.[](/lunagasp) I say!  What is this madness!this is not an invite link so it doesn't work unless you're already on the server. [](/lunasad)Seriously though.  I have no idea what r/place is or how to participate. Go to this post. Read the instructions. Do your part.

https://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/62ozd4/the_rmylittlepony_community_needs_to_work/dfo7hxy/I saw a giant rainbow dash being made up in the upper right corner 

Edit: Near, but not really at the upper right corner [](/scootaderp) We have a Discord?GUYS, USE DARK GREEN! [](/rdsalute)I'm currently concentrating on fixing the orange of the tail, best of luck!And just now it's 20 lol. I figure it's got more attention now, and they can't handle quite so many inputs.[](/whattheflut) With that username I'd assume so. [Nicely done!](http://i.imgur.com/hWav5pd.png)http://imgur.com/a/0OnzU I think that is the only good screenshot that we will get before it gets overrun by people[](/ajhappy)Taking a look around I think Rainbow is one of the more coordinated images going. Nice job folks![](/dashiescared)I didnt realise the sub edited that name until I hovered over it Honestly it's a toss-up whether blue, green lattice, or rainbow road reach it first. Clearing some whitespace or maybe adding a border of grey might be good.[](/pinkie) I think Rainbow Road will embrace it and not destroy it. :D[](/raritywhine) My OCD is killing me over the fact that "Ponies!" isn't centered[](/celestiawut) I... don't know how to react to this revelation. On one hand this is a *neat feature*.

Hopefully they'll adhere to it.[](/twisecret) https://www.reddit.com/r/place/#x=773&amp;y=434

We started making this:

We're here: http://imgur.com/a/i6uWs[](/ohcomeon) Where are you guys organizing this? I can't believe i wasted so many of my moves on making random junk when this was being created. [](/twiponder) Alright how about this:

https://manechat.horse/The outline is the beginning of the end. Learn from the past. Move on to the dashheart. They also changed it back to 5 minutes for a while.

...then back to 10 again.....[](/bulkbiceps) I'm doing my part!

[](/eeyup) I'm doing my part!

[](/sp)
[](/scootacheer) I'm doing my part too!

[](/rdsmile)[](/twipride)[](/swagintosh) *Sensible Chuckle Here*[](/sneakybelle) AYE AYE CAPTAIN!I can here to say "ok which one of you is doing this".
Saw it on /r/place first before I heard about it here.http://i.imgur.com/cMfkFGP.gifI've been working tirelessly to attempt to gently caress Pinkie in loving blue to keep her safe. However, there are a few Chaotic Blues that keep trying to attack her interior. Know that they do not represent all Blues! Please don't give up on Pinkie!I went to that post. 


I saw no instructions. 


I can't do my part. 


[](/cryponk) [](/soawesome) We're doing great, guys! Even with fighting off the trolls we're still making progress.

[Keep it going!](http://imgur.com/a/hmdK1)[](/rdhuh) Scootaloo, I thought you knew this... we've had a draconequus for years!This is almost as good as twitch plays pokemon.[](/huhhuh)Hi Abom! I've been using most of my pixels on Dashie but I'm gonna help Dossy work on a snoo for us now. Pinkie has been corrupted by the Blues, I fear. As much as I hate to abandon her, I think the Dashheart is for the best.Yeah, I've shifted to counter vandalism on Dashie. It's hard to start something new up because of the expansion of Rainbow Road. We have to move fast to get enough up for them to recognize it as art and get protection. Plus with my timer at 20 mins that doesn't work. So I just do touch up work here. [almost done](https://gyazo.com/247f514f7d9e1d794f610141cb786c83)[](/joy) Great job everyone! If we can get people to stick around to fight the vandals we can keep her pristine!Ponk is lost, Blues are scum Is Pinkie nearby? Rainbow's pretty much done, wondering what to work on now. Maybe a cloud for her to sit on + blue background.

Edit: oh, pinkie is being consumed by blue corner. Lol that's kind of creepy actually.She's on the right edge, above the blue corner. She'd pretty beat up though. Lets make a border around her then. If nothing else it would buy us time before she gets marked onhttps://manechat.horse/https://manechat.horse/[deleted][](/ajwut)Honestly I'm just surprised it's still standing. 

[](/sp)

[](/raritygrump)TO ARMS DASHIE DEFENDERS! WE MUST PRESERVE HER!We might want to fix it. It went from ponies to penifsYes, we must stay on this.Maybe not, but the question was 'what do you think?'.

[](/ppshrug)That's what I think.Explain Derpy, then. [](/derp-in)

Either she has lousy eyesight or 26-D vision.[](/rajsly)Well, _HJPEV_ wears glasses.
[](/sp)
[](/hmmm)Can't remember if that was ever addressed. I'm pretty sure the question of why wizards are still fat or ugly if they have magic came up at some point early on.Equestria isn't exactly known for it either.The latter.I don't think anyone would argue that the Harry Potter series is a paragon of logic though.I would bet Moon Dancer probably needs glasses to read and it's fuzzy for her without glasses. 

Most of the time people with glasses just have a little fuzzyness when they take them off. People don't go blind without their glasses. Everything just gets fuzzy. I could still walk up to a building and open a door if everything was reduced to blurry shapes. Because I'm not stupid and I know where and what everything is. But personally for me it's just a minor fuzzyness. I don't need glasses to read and see eveything, I just prefer to have glasses because it makes everything clearer. 


In a society where magic exists, I would be willing to bet that Moondancer originally wore her glasses just for show, to make other ponies think that she was an intellectual. In reality her vision is perfect, but she's gotten so used to wearing her glasses now she puts them on unconsciously.[](/moondancerfrown)Moondancer: *"Gah! My glasses! I can't see without my glasses! Jinkies!"*

...but seriously, I think she only needs them when reading. More a case of farsightedness than any literal blindness.[](/ajfrown)Depends on how much logic you want to apply to a magical society. Harry Potter wears glasses.Fair point.[](/hmmm)Human Twilight wears glasses while Pony Twilight does not. 

It could be possible Twilight is an example of a pony getting their vision fixed via magic.HPMOR uses the "transfiguration is not permanent" thing to explain the existence of ugly witches and wizards, and since poor eyesight is (often) caused by the physical shape of the eyeball, the same would presumably apply there.To aid mobile users, I'll link small subreddits not yet linked in the comments

[](/sp)[](/lunamad) Luna would still have been better though. [](/cheerilee) We did it, Reddit![](/twiponder) Guess we just keep doing maintenance then. 

Did the time get longer, again? I suspect it'll keep doubling from here on out. So that should stop massive take-overs. Hey /r/mylittlepony!
Who would be interested in building a little Pinkie Pie down with OSU? They are planning on letting artwork that is Pink hang out on their logo, and Pinkie Pie is very pink. Thoughts? Interest?I think a rectangular area is easer to protect and makes it less likely someone else will try and encroach on our space. 

That being said, I think it might be a good idea to change the color from black to something else (pale blue?).Can we add a sunset shimmer 3x3 tile near celestial?Me neither.[](/rdsnrk) Oh, yeah, I meant on RD's cutie mark, next to the red and yellow of the lightning bolt. I applaud the Celestia and Luna attempts but they are kind of...messy.Starting to think Celestia and Luna are a lost cause. They looked nice when they were 3x3, but I'm not sure how or why people are expanding them. Seems like we're wasting effort fighting ourselves here.

Celestia looked nice before, and I think Luna could look good as:


Blue | Blue | Grey
----|----|----
**Blue** | **Grey** | **Grey**
**Black** | **Blue** | **Blue**

But if other people have ideas, I'm all for them. We just need something better orchestrated than whatever it is right now.[](/rcelestiawut)For some reason Sunbutt and Moonbutt seem to have all the grief aggro.

[](/sp)

[](/ppboring)Celestia and Luna successfully protecting something? Whoda thunk it?About an hour late, but I'll try and help out!Have some bonus points!Hey! We over at /r/savedashie &amp; the MLP Discord Manechat edited the template slightly, so she now has the proper three colors and thunderbolt shape to her cutie mark! Three red pixels, two yellow, and one dark blue. Hopefully we don't fight between the one that is just a red and yellow line and the new look.Yeah, I'm not on the Discord, but I have a working 1-1 .xcf file I created and am also editing the human friendly version as well. Keeping my stuff updated is slightly lagging yours and I missed the new cutie mark for quite a while lol.  
I'm stalking the subreddit tho.Well I'll be darned, they changed them. I was using the pattern from the original file. Time to update them I guess.  
Thanks for noticing.  
Edit: Updated.I'm enjoying clicking on the user profiles of people vandalizing her, and seeing comments like, "can we get rid of this pony shit?"

"Fucking bronies."

It's great.Curses! Time to edit!I honestly assumed the heart was originally us, meant to be Fluttershy and just was left unfinished. Is that not the case?[](/flutteryay) Nice job guys! Keep up the good work!I think we're starting to lose it. If we don't get reinforcements soon, it'll probably be gone in a few hours.&gt;I'll send /r/halo a message and let them know that if they want to take over the "PONIES" banner thing then they can

[](/flutterwink)

Way ahead of you...I'm hijacking the top comment to say that Rainbow Dash is suffering heavy damage atm, she needs your help! [](/e33)We're trucking along steadily, it's been more or less like this the whole day (I'm not sure if I'm proud, that I've been doing this the whole damn day...)Might be due to the decreased timer. It's easier to vandalize and they can do it with greater rapidity.[](/starlightrage)Don't fire until you see the whites of their tiles!The void does not preserve art. We need to surround RD with rainbow road instead IMO. It seems to be randomly attacked by void placers since it's surrounded by black.

EDIT: Replaced blue with Rainbow Road, as pointed out by /u/Big_Green_Piccolo[](/scootablue) A 2 pixel wide white border was my original idea, but I couldn't fight back against the tide of black. And then I went to bed and when I woke up we had an entire black box.I'd be okay with it, as long as it doesn't cut all that much. Not that I'm an official representative or anythingI'd let it be. It's basically impossible to patrol both that and Rainbow at the same time with the active numbers we seem to have now. I think keeping Rainbow intact is more important.We're trying to remove it. It just attracts vandals.You're right. Maybe we should be building rainbow road out through the nearby gaps.That would be fine by me. As long as it doesn't start cutting into the yellow bit, I think it could work.I mean like, outline her completely in a veil of purple then indigo then blue etc. The road will notice.Oh. That makes sense. Good thing I was working on the body.We can hardly keep her clean as it is, I don't think we have the manpower to build a fresh border this late into the game. Unless you can talk the folks at /r/ainbowroad to take the project, then it might be doable.I think trying to preserve the PONIES sign is taking too many resources to maintain. It's just way to easy to make it say PENIS or something.Seconded. It'd be nice to really coordinate with others.[](/pinkiepout)True, we're trying to erase it too, but not everyone follows this thread so we're also fighting amongst ourselves...I think he may be talking about the attempt to fill in the purple part of her tail with cyan*Edit: which has already been fixed GOOD JOB). Someone is being crafty trying to mess her up subtly.[deleted]Do you think it's working? 

In any case we need to step up our game.help r/halo, it will help us in the long run while we defend RDi would avoid covering sans. He did nothing wrong. and we dont need that space. Just focus on repairing Rainbow for now!Looks like some people are trying to add [this to the bottom right](http://orig15.deviantart.net/f163/f/2012/136/d/a/fluttershy_pixel_by_zztfox-d5003n9.png).[](/spikehappy)Yeah, I should have joined the Discord discussion earlier on. It's still a pretty nice picture, and when we look back on it, I'll just be proud we made our mark.I got excited about this until I refreshed and it didn't do anything :(VOID WILL DEVOUR[](/twidaw)We are gonna love and tolerate the shit out of the void. Some people have started on an elements of harmony concept: http://imgur.com/a/QctuMI think if we change the P to an R and add a B in front it will sour the milk for those vandals. ;)now its poopin itself!!I was there for the Genesis of black outline but slept through whatever meeting decided thisHey, vandals are gaining ground again!Yup, it's getting out of hand.[](/rstarlightrage)***THE POOP-FIENDS MUST BE ELIMINATED!!!***Anyone up for sending this over to EQD asking for help?[](/derpwizard) Yeahh, they don't look amazing. It's the meaning behind them that counts though, right? Yeah, I've been blacking it out until I just saw this.

I have a few friends who have been working on this in general who don't even follow the sub, and I'm sure there's more..It's at 20 minutes right now. I don't know if that's to reduce server load or, as you suggest, to slow things down after the initial rush to create.[](/ppshrug) I only said that because it was at 5, then it went to 10, now it's at 20. The server load should've gone way down at this point anyways. [](/scootaplease)Just went to ten minutes again for me. Honestly they should do the doubling thing, then once the delay reaches over a few hours lock the current Place, archive it, and start a new one with new timers and start the whole process all over again.

Edit: Never mind. Apparently r/place will only be around for a day so reddit could do something not cringeworthy for April 1.Well scuttlebutt is that it won't last long. Haven't seen anything official, though.

Here's hoping that an individual piece doesn't necessarily last long, and that they archive them and start new ones over time. Hell just make it permanent. If it becomes slow it becomes slow, and specific concentrated efforts will probably pop up organically.[](/ppshrug)Not sure. Focus on covering up the side with the swastika?[removed][removed]It seems that [Green Lattice is offering an aliance](https://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/62r6tk/green_lattice_around_rainbow_dash/?st=j0z0p41w&amp;sh=7653f007). Maybe we should accept them instead of the black border.[](/abstern) Ah'm doin' mah part![](/dontbeabutt) [Hey, you!...](https://ponymotes.net/view/dontbeabutt)The background is finished![Finished!](https://i.gyazo.com/0d0199434e55cb0e6a12a573eb54455e.png)[](/ppawe) wow, you guys really did get her done. I didn't do much, but wow, it's nice to know it got done and... looks pretty good. 

-GM, master of werewhere. Went to dreamland, guess you guys and gals did a great job. I'm proud of ya.

And now the cooldown time is 10 minutes, which means less frequency of random non-horse-fans destroying dashie![deleted][Do what I did, give her an Applejack companion!](http://i.imgur.com/pX9td.jpg)I thought that was supposed to be 'yay'. Not sure what it was now though, seems to be mostly erased. Defending the word 'ponies' myself.Beautiful! Sleepy RD is slowly dying. We need more people to help save her!Well gossip is that we are allowed to expand to the current effort and see where that goes.around 20 minutes ago, I was able to paint pixels without cooldown for some reason. I tried to restore RD and the text. The quantity of grieffing didn't allow me to do much before the "pixel euphoria" ended.

Has this happened to any of you? Not the grieffing part, I'm talking about the non-cooldown pixels part.

EDIT: It's happening again.
EDIT2: The changes I did weren't saved when I reloaded the page. I guess /r/place is having some overload issues, or maybe it's just my PC. Mystery solved.Thank you for the explanation kind sir! Now let's protect our little Dashie!Same for me. Looked at the canvas, saw Dash and started helping to keep her clean. One of the best artworks on there!.She is taking a shit! remove it! clean RD!seriously, please focus on keeping the brown out. it's not what we need.Can we put a heart in front of 'ponies !!!' To take up that space and look lovely?!?[](/flutterfear) Guys, we may inadvertently end up helping the Void with that black border. It likes to crawl into any art that contains black pixels, it already infected the Mona Lisa.

Be very careful, don't let the void consume Rainbow Dash.My game must be frozen then -- no need to be hostile :PMaybe we should erase "ponies!!" altogether? They keep turning it into some form of "penis" like the morons they are.All of the this. RD is the most important part. let them have the word if it means RD is safe.Sometimes the pixel color and pixel credits update at different times.We could spare some space for the Sans, takes a small load off of our backs too. We don't really need that black empty space that desperately.Looks like the skull from below and the green lattice from the right side are starting to intrude on our background a bit

[](/snails) [](/twisad) [](/fillytgap)I don't have a problem with the Sans skull. He won't interfere with RD herself.[removed][](/hmmm)I'm getting some weird discrepancies with the state of the "place". I see things change in real time every now and again, but when I reload the page things appear to have changed much more drastically. Is that normal?Thank you friend [](/ajugh) People keep changing the O to an E. 

I agree keeping RD clean is the most important part. I only somewhat agree. The text provides an easy target for the griefers, distracting them from messing with the pixel art below.&gt;Other than making sure it doesn't become something obscene

Unless we delete the text outright, we're going to need to continue to constantly edit it from saying 'PENISS!!!'My three alt-accounts and I are on the case!"Other than making sure it doesn't become something obscene"

Pretty sure that's exactly what's happening. Considering that only 5 pixels are needed to change it to... that... it's a bit problematic. Considering that, I think it was probably very misguided to put the banner there.We need to have priorities.

1. Keep the text from becoming obscene
2. Keep RD from becoming obscene/maimed (i.e. major changes)
3. Clean up "random" pixels

A few pixels here and there isn't really that bad, focus on the big things.Would it be easier to simply make the "ponies" black space? I've been watching it turn into "penis" over and over.[deleted]Are we covering the 'ponies !!!' Header now with black to concentrate on RD? I'm using a lot on covering 'penis'??!?just focus on RD from now, don't even bother about the graffiti. RD needs our help!Five minute cooldown is active! GOGOGOGOGOGO!That is a good idea!I agree.I get the feeling that not everyone who is helping, is reading the sub 😂🙃[](/ssindeed)The whole point of the text is to draw attention from dash. It's bait, and a lot easier to fix than dash.Ooo just had a glitch that let me keep placing pixels but when it refreshes my hard work hadn't stuck! Worth a shot![](/raritygrump)Hold fast! We won't let these ruffians ruin our hard work! Somebody is screwing with the cutie mark. I'm keeping them at bay for now.It would force helpers who arent reading the sub to concentrate on RD and not waste pixels on letters if we got rid of the letters.&gt; lower timers seems to be in our favor for some reason.

More people are able to help fix art pieces in general with more clicks. If their "domain" art piece is safe, they can fix other peoples' as well. I hate to leave when the haters seem on the rise, but I'm not gonna sit on this on a weekend night (1:40 am here)... Hold fast, my fellow cleaners!We shouldn't mess with anyone else's art. If you want to try adding her do it nearby in the random pixel area.[](/twismile) I just picked the sleepy heart because it had a good pixel guide.

[](/twiponder) It might be interesting to try to change the pony each day, but I think that would be too hard to coordinate with a large and spread out group. Likely it will take most of our efforts just to keep her intact over the coming [week/however long this goes].[](/pinkiepout) Green Lattice is making me so worried... oh please, oh please leave her alone! T_TIs that us, expanding the black outline into a black background? [](/taviannoyed)We need to find out why folks keep putting a black pixel at 774 428.

It needs to go at 774 429 or 430. The bit that goes under her hair is clearly lower than the rest of her eye.

Ah, screw it, I'll just contribute to the border.most people are going with [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/62z65j/the_newest_rplace_template/) template.I think that may actually be an advantage. The vandals probably don't recognize it as anything other than random pixels, so they may leave it alone.Just be careful not to overextend us. We need to carefully manage our resources. Maybe I should run some calculations to determine how much we can expand. Of course that would require knowing how many of us are contributing and the rate of vandalism.It's funny. They've been trying to do it for 12+ hours now and probably celebrate when it's penis for less than 3 seconds.Thanks to all our hard work. I though the word was a bad idea, but it seems we can manage it so idk it's okay I guess.I do like the thouht of it being r/mlp, but sadly r/mylittlepony is the actual subreddit, and r/mlp is a dead subreddit. Like someone else said it is the biggest troll magnet. Make sure to use the template folks, it's getting annoying to fix the work of people who are trying to help but are not looking at the template.  
Just for reference it is over [here](http://i.imgur.com/Uv9c5Pj.png).  
Edit: I'm more concerned about RD herself, not so much the surrounding area where people have been adding Celestia and Luna.  
Edit: I added Celestia and Luna to the template.Been at it all day. Can't wait to see the final product in the morning.... or in a couple hours. This was pretty cool to be a part of.idk, it seems like the focus has shifted back to RD.Ah, yeah, luckily it doesn't seem like the vandalism is too big an issue with adding more within our border. The only real issue with adding stuff was apparently some people are running scripts to keep it repaired, so the people trying to add extra cutie mark stuff were having trouble with the sun/moon. Seems they've got em done now, at least.Organized in the Discord chat! Someone turned the "PONIES" into "PUNIES". I was half tempted to leave it that way (someone else fixed it though).[](/rdsalute) This Lunar Guard is out for the night. It's been a long night of keeping RD graffiti-free. Also helped out BerryTube's Berry Punch cutie mark, Undertale, Halo, and other neighbors over the last couple hours.  
  
Keep the Pegasus ~~sleeping~~ flying! I don't know how long r/place is going to be around, but I hope we're still there on the canvas at the end of it![](/tiredtavi)I wasted some pixels, didn't refresh enough. But I kept at it all night. Time for sleep. [](/lunamad)People are starting to mess up Dash in more subtle ways. Keep an eye on the template.Ok guys right now we have a new template!  
[Here](http://i.imgur.com/RhM2rJX.png) it is!Will support that. Great job lads!we need some fixes at the tip of the tail.Been protecting her for 8 hours, being a pastel horse bodyguard is a full time job!

It is the end of my shift brothers, don't let her down!Not really part of your community or fan base, but she's *too adorable* to let vandals destroy. From the very first bit of her head being formed, I knew. The majority of my tiles are going to maintenance for her.

Also, Dash has just been completed!: [Here](http://i.imgur.com/4FiVgkZ.png) is the current state and surroundings at time of completion.
[deleted][](/abhat) Hey from /r/straya. These cunts were nice enough to give us the space for our roo with no issues.  Treat them well. [](/rdsalute)We're on their [list of art](https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenLattice/comments/62rjfy/current_goals/) so they should leave us alone![](/guard)The word "PONIES" is under heavy attack.Ooo found this sub from your sleepy RD, I even had chance to change a rogue orange pixel back to blue ☺️👏🏻🙌🏻[](/ajfrown)

Am I the only one who finds it odd this thing isn't covered in dicks and swastikas?On it. Someone's trying to write gay in the bottom left corner! Or at least a word that starts with GA.And she won't stop pooping.and people are changing "Ponies!"  to  "penises"[](/scootacheer)Working on it! Thank goodness they reduced the wait time![](/notangry)They're adding brown pixels near her butt. I'm gonna do one more, then go to sleep, because this is making me irrationally angry for whatever reason.Keep up the good work! [](/rdsalute)[deleted]For defenders waiting to repair, [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Undertale/comments/62q5rq/come_help_us_build_sans_right_next_to_papyrus_on/dfon8zy/) is the template for the Undertale characters beneath.  

[](/scootaplease "/shrug")we defend him to the death, for the celestia! [](/abcrusade)[](/notangry) Defend the Dash!!When that happens, it's actually that reddit isn't registering your pixel placement. Only the last one you place actually goes through.Rainbow Dash is under concentrated fire by vandals right now.  She's going fast, so anybody with time available come help the good fight!I agree, but the limited colors lends more to RDAre you for real? Check coordinates one more time. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/ATzFsjI.png) is my edit. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/P6cWS6w.png) is this place on the template.[removed][](/rdsmile) Yeah, it's freezes sometimes. I actually thought you were confused with the template or chose the wrong pixel. Just harmless misunderstanding.Fellow RD guards, I'd say forget the "PONIES!!!" banner on top. If there's anything we can learn from The Blue Corner it's that trying to expand out of your scope is pure hubris and can only end in tragedy. Other than making sure it doesn't become something obscene, I'd say focus on keeping RDs butt squeaky clean and her eyes free of blood tears![removed]Works for me. Title is also of concern.Probably internet related issues on your side.&gt; blood tears

What a horrible night to have a curseI've been getting that too. I always refresh before I place my tile to make sure I have the most up to date picture.r/mylittlepenisStop fixing the title allready,  and focus on RD, she is more important, i see you guys.[](/ccarmor) Then we shall stand and protect those around us! Just need to keep the heals flowing in.easier perhaps, but not as important as restoring RD, we need more people on that.That's why I want us to stop wasting colours on 'ponies !!!' 😊 EDIT: Didn't want RD to end and be immortalised with 'Penis' above when this all ends! SO CUTE!Alright, focus on RD, she's now got black sunglasses. Stop correcting the title, focus in RD. Let the trolls fight to try and make a swear word. I doubt they are co ordinated to complete it.Guys. It seems that Master Chief is starting to expand on the top of the background. Should we be worried?I think we need to ditch the text altogether. It is TOO EASY to vandalize it to "peniss". It is too good of a target and we are losing resources in vain.

If we want a text, We need a bigger font and a simpler word, **PONY** or **MLP** or **FIM**.Rainbow's eye is starting to get screwed up. Halp!"Ponies!!!" needs to go, and by "needs to go" I mean, "I have actively started to erase it."

It is so much wasted effort. Not to mention it'd look much better as all black anyway. Rainbow would be much more striking on a pure black background. And "Ponies!!!" isn't even centered anyway.

I am working on erasing it. I will do so in a way that it can't morph into certain other words. But it *really* needs to go.For a second I thought you were bm'ing then I realized what you meant. 

Honestly I agree. It's too easy to vandalize anyways. /r/mlp wouldn't be a bad substitute or something but I think blacking it over would be best. [deleted][deleted]I'm wondering if we should just let it go and abandon that part. I'm barely keeping the cutie mark together as is.[deleted]Ok we need more help. All things considered, I really am surprised she wasn't completely destroyed when she first went up.[](/f33) Right on! [deleted][](/hmmm) But, what if they aren't using white tiles?Why not rainbows? She's close enough to Rainbow Road as it is.[](/fluttershy)I thought that were were trying to get rid of it. I feel like we need many more users to help protect both artworks.http://manechat.horse/
We are in #mylittleactivitiesHey it looks like they're letting up all of a sudden!! ATTACKFor those helping, we are coordinating in the http://manechat.horse/ discord server, in the #mylittleactivities channelI got in the discord and asked about it. It seems they believe it's a buffer against the trolls and vandals who would otherwise be attacking Dashie.i've seen the P in ponies  changed to a swastika, it didn't last long[](/darktwi)I just realized I am not fit to maintain the orange. Looks almost like the green squares to me. I am so sorry RD! [](/fluttershh)I don't mean to be pedantic, but I'm slightly bothered with the template's cutie mark. Wouldn't it be better if it was more [lightning shaped](https://imgur.com/a/zPOg1)? Or at the very least incorporated any sort of blue at all, like the actual cutie mark?

Although, this late in the game, it's gonna be pretty hard to make changes while everyone's gone into full defense mode.Yeah, I just pulled the image from the web because it had a grid layout already all set. There are definitely some things I could have improved on it.

I agree it's too late now, though.yep.We are already trying to maintain the black space. Might as well use it for something.I've spent the last 20 minutes making the word ponies above it not say peniss anymore. Almost done!Appreciated. I purpose rezoning our southern border in order to give sans room to continue their blue outline, to give /r/parahumansplace a token of appreciation, and to have less to maintain!

I also wish we could coordinate on our northern border with halo, though at the same time, to give up our lettering would be symbolic of over-ambition and failure, so I'm still prepared to defend it to the death if need be. Dash takes priority \#1 no matter what though.[](/flutteryay) *YAY!*[](/a14) Much appreciated, outlander!We have a sub for this now, if anyone wants to discuss there. /r/savedashie 

Also here's the template for [Fluttershy](http://orig15.deviantart.net/f163/f/2012/136/d/a/fluttershy_pixel_by_zztfox-d5003n9.png), in case anyone wants to help on that. [deleted]So then why are you contributing to the damage? http://i.imgur.com/qgunSmN.pngAlso probably worth mentioning https://github.com/tea-drinker/saveDashie, a Python script designed to automatically keep Dashie maintained when you otherwise wouldn't be able to be at your computer.

Takes a bit of programming know-how though to set up. Also I don't think it's been updated to include the Elements of Harmony or extra exclamation points yet, so it'll probably treat those as vandalism.[](/twithinking)To be dead wouldn't it have had to be be alive first? [](/twiponder)The EoH don't really hold up in pixel form. Took me like eight different viewings to realize what that yellow thing in the top left was, even when it was perfect much of the time.Why is the lightning bolt on her cutie mark wrong?Maybe it's just that they want to rewrite it to spell "penis", otherwise maybe they would go away?????[](/nightmaregrin) Thanks for the help! The Batponies are here to guard Dashie through the night.[](/twipbbt) I told you I picked her because she's the most iconic pony. We'd never get anywhere if we had to fight between everyone's favorite pony. [](/sp)

[](/twiright) And don't say I'm just biased, because my favorite is Twilight.[](/awwyeah)Yaaaaaaaaaay!I like the idea of creating a space/border around RD so she stands out. I feel like we should respect whoever is trying to build their flag next to us though (if that's what the brown square intersecting RD is). If we work together then maybe we can form an alliance \^\^.

Looks like someone's trying to build a black border on one side too. I think an outline of any kind would look good and help protect her. Light blue is my preference, but I'll contribute to the current effort and see where that goes.Did you pick sleepy RD because there is a "sleepy art" of each of the Mane 6?

Be cool if we could make it "transform" every day! Everypony wins!I think people were trying to add Celestia and Luna on opposite sides. I haven't seen a template for that. It looked kinda cool when the Celestia was first done, but I have no idea what that mess is now.Huh.Seriously, I hope that isn't some master ruse that when completed is something from another fandom.So this is the new sprite we are going with, I updated it for Celestia and Luna.  
You can find it over [here](http://i.imgur.com/0UkuTkh.png).  
Edit: Updated to the more recent version.
Edit: Updated Again.So what are we doing about the red/gold bull circle that's invading ours and Halo's space? It looks like they're trying to eat through the PONIES exclamation points and part of Master Chief.  
  
I'm not on the Discord, so unsure whether we're officially cool with this or not.[](/colgate)Hey all, lurker here coming on behalf of r/furry asking for help, if you have a spare pixel, could you throw it at our Snoo in the blue corner? It should look like [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/297948120682201088/297985824950190081/0_Snoo_2.png) but it is a uphill battle, and any help is appreciated. 

Thanks in advance, and I personally will keep splitting my pixels between Dash and Snoo. Hey /r/furry! I'll gladly throw a pixel your way!That's very helpful, thank you.Your welcome! Also I updated it slightly.Huh. I'll update my files then. This looks much better.  
Edit 2: New updated photo [here](http://i.imgur.com/RP3hEKF.png).[](/rdsalute) Approved, accepted, and adopted![](/dhoops-r) Seems you have the blue and red pixels reversed for the bottom-right icon.Can we keep this design for cutie mark (because it's in the corrct order and people keep changing to it anyway)?  http://i.imgur.com/6aGZrQy.pngWell I'm going to get some sleep. If any more changes are made my files will be out of date:

Edit: Updated Again.  
Edit 2: I'm back! Seems like nothing changed in the 7 hours I've been unconscious for.I fixed it! Thanks![](/dashsmile) In case anypony missed it, here's the new template:

https://www.reddit.com/r/SaveDashie/comments/62ywtt/It wouldn't be that hard at all. less difficult than creating it to begin with. Just make a post everyday with the grid guide and we'd be golden.I'm wondering if I should go talk to them as an emissary, or diplomatic envoy from one sub to another \^\^.sleepy RD is the most notable/common of them[](/soawesome) Great work everyone who helped create her and helped keep her vandal free! [](/sp)

[](/rdsalute) We still need your help, though. The pony haters and general vandals aren't going to stop, so we need people to keep an eye on RD and keep her pristine. [](/sp)

[](/rdsmile) Also, if you have extra pixels to burn and RD doesn't need a touch up, we could add a small white space around her to help her stand out from the background noise. [](/sp)

EDIT: [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/#x=773&amp;y=434) is the link to her coordinates and [here](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/83/27/83/832783dde19dc4984d018fc68d0308a0.gif) is the pattern we're using, in case you want to help and need a reference.[](/lunateehee) I know, I'm just a butt. [](/fluttershh) Are we working on setting up a blue border around her as well? It'd probably be worth a shot.[](/ppshrug) Took a look around, supposedly the blue corner is [indiscriminately supportive of pixel art](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/62pi3e/mighty_blue_corner_please_do_not_destroy_our_pony/), they have a thread running to [preserve art.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBlueCorner/comments/62ppdp/art_preservation/)[](/rdcool) Yeah, her face is a prime vandalism target.

[](/rdsalute) Thank you for helping.No, it's some other group. You could easily squeeze Fluttershy in just below the pink heart if you wanted, though.

Just beware that the larger the area our pony art covers, the more we'll need to defend.I believe so.I'm amazed it was completed before being griefedhttp://www.braceletbook.com/pattern_alpha/12007.html
Oh, the grief was a constant thing as we built it (and is still happening now, in fact), we just have enough people watching her to quickly fix mistakes.[](/karma) Looks great![] (/rdsalute) Roger that. Fuuuck, only a day? Damn, I was looking forward to grabbing a new screen for my newish phone so I could actually take part D:Is there somebody [starting a classic Mario next to us?] (https://www.reddit.com/r/place#x=766&amp;y=449) Within the projected black square? We need more people if we want to create that border! All blocks go for defence :(
Doing my best to help here!&gt; We're closer to green grid and rainbow than blue corner.

Has anyone contacted /r/ainbowroad yet to confirm her safety? I'd think they'd probably be amenable since she is *Rainbow* Dash after all, but it would be best to get her officially recognized before they get there.[](/rppshrug) I just [followed the design](https://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/62ozd4/slug/dfo7hxy).Yeah, but there are lots of griefers still..Great job, i have been fixing her all morning long!I love the irony of you helping movie users, using formatting not supported on mobile./u/DR_Zorand how to contact those behind it

To remove the rude words people are vandalizing RD with![](/dashcozy) Now we just got to make it look like that again.Take a look at one of the time lapses and you'll see how much activity there was fixing the griefers. [deleted][](/rdsalute)  [Don't let her die!](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/83/27/83/832783dde19dc4984d018fc68d0308a0.gif)i would love to know this.~~[Then don't vandalize it yourself, please!](http://i.imgur.com/57tudlV.png)~~

Edit: Game doesn't show color updates but does show the new updated username?Feels like playing with a Tamagotchi all over again.oh god too true...agreed.Yeah, I think it was a bad idea to include that. If nothing else it gives them an easy target.

With just the drawing, as long as we remain vigilant most of them would get bored quickly. Their random pixels get fixed so they see no progress. But the words are so much easier to change, the vandals will stick around to keep trying to ruin in.Yeah -- gonna switch to Chrome and see if that helps at all.[](/eeyup)

Been at it for a good while...

We're holding up quite decently for the time being. It is a constant battle though.[removed]True[](/cadancesmile)I would gladly give green lattice the background space (beyond, say, a 2-pixel outline). It's easily the most visually pleasing pattern to be spreading on there, and they did come to our sub with peaceful intentions earlier!As long as greenlattice allows rd to stay...Of course. They were planning to, earlier, so I say let them encroach for now and see how far they go. Of course that's just my view, I'll just keep cleaning RD up and not touching the bcg either way.Yeah i just went to /r/Greenlattice and they plan to keep her, she is on their art list :D.I guess if we lose track of the title it can way too easily be changed into something quite penile, but I prioritize cleaning up RD to it anyway for some reason. Maybe because I can see changing the word as at least somewhat amusing, but putting random pixels in the picture is just dumb vandalism.Well, the rest of the internet works just fine, but I suppose it's not a problem to F5 when my ten minutes expire to more accurately see what needs changing. I wonder if I've been making redundant fixes all this time.I've got to head out for now, but I'll be back later tonight to resume guard duties of the Rainbow Friendship Kingdom.  
  
I think someone's trying to vandalize RD's cutie mark into the German flag, might want to keep an eye on that.[](/sbwtf)Why are we not letting Sans go over our black background?! It would look far better, less to defend, and we're kinda destroying part of it just to keep a black slate?it looks like r/undertale is putting sans in our border. i vote we let them and focus on keeping RD safe
I'm not so sure about that. I think the text is drawing more people than would otherwise be griefing us because it's so much easier to see progress in changing the text. If all we had was Rainbow Dash and we kept her clean I suspect a lot of them would lose interest and leave.we should delete the word. and replace it with MLP, it'll be harder to grief and easier to defend

[deleted][] (/scootacheer) C'mon guys! We can do this! Keep RD Safe!Somebody has just posted a replica of the whole 'place' and it doesn't look like it says ponies on top if you get my drift 🙃 fight the colourful fight xPeople look like they're trying to make her a stallion given the shape forming in the black region near her rear end... [](/maud)Actively erasing it seems like wasted effort compared to maintaining RD pristine...Let /r/halo invade it.Could just be me, but I think we're starting to get a surge in vandalsAnd don't forget... it's not centered and it makes me uncomfortableIf they don't have a base to work with, or a goal (like: "Hur dur, let's make the PONIES say *this* instead"), their efforts will become uncoordinated and their interest waning. Having that big giant word which is just 5 pixels away from transforming our sweetness into something vulgar is just a flashing neon sign saying "Vandalize me! Vandalize me!"

Random dots will happen to RD herself; this can't be changed. But at the very least we'll no longer be fighting off efforts to having a vulgar word over our pony, and can focus on keeping her clean.Also good point.I'll try.Nah, /r/halo has been super cool about not expanding because they get that we're drawing more attention than they are with vandals, so we're retroactively keeping their master chief safe. We should let them expand down. I'll send /r/halo a message and let them know that if they want to take over the "PONIES" banner thing then they can, if everybody's okay with that.What subreddit would we pick? We need to be careful, because just advertising its existence can attract even more vandals.**Here's a sneak peek of [/r/GreenLattice](https://np.reddit.com/r/GreenLattice) using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/GreenLattice/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all) of all time!**

It's probably just a better idea to just get rid of the word altogether.It shouldn't cut more than two or three tiles, if done right.Guys? Our face border is looking pretty shaky...

Edit: Threat gone! It was a bunch of red lettering. On the other side we have an incoming Flutter I believe! YAY! Eternal is great. He was working on the Pinkie Pie on the bottom before it got devoured. ;(Yeah, maybe some small pixel changes but no global destruction or anything.Reddit crashed and gave me unlimited tile placements. Is there any way we can make this happen for real? https://imgur.com/gallery/HMabH[From nerfed thread]
Some tips:  
 - Make sure to check the ref that you're placing pixels in the right spot - let's not waste any pixels!  http://i.imgur.com/RP3hEKF.png  
 - Refresh the page before placing a pixel - it seems the canvas gets out of sync fairly easily  
 - Focus on the Dashie first, then text/background  
 - The Sans below us should be allowed to overlap - don't waste pixels there  
 - We have been recognized as art by Rainbow Road and Green Latice - We shouldn't have problems with them  
 - We are coordinating in the http://manechat.horse/ discord server, in the #mylittleactivities channel - feel free to join us!  

EDIT: Direct link to the coordinates: https://www.reddit.com/place?webview=true#x=779&amp;y=435  
EDIT2: Updated Ref Template  
EDIT3: We now have our own subreddit as well! https://www.reddit.com/r/SaveDashie/That's a bug.  Only you can see the tiles you place and they will reset if you refresh the page.  Happened to me very early on.That might've been some overzealous members of us at r/Parahumans (r/ParahumansPlace). WE'RE SORRY and trying to get people to stop.Kudos on keeping your space nice and clean. You guys seem pretty good at keeping vandalism in check.Uh oh!

https://i.imgur.com/kf35A8T.pngI think if we change the P to an R and add a B in front it will sour the milk, and make it more difficult to change to what they want.

[](/ppcute) There was one red dot placement that made me think of Rudolph the reindeer.Keep it going guys! The black dots keep trying to encroach!Alright, new tactic, I say we let /r/Halo have the "PONIES" section. That is just too hard to keep, it's a lost cause.I kind of like that PONIES is a griefer magnet. Keeps some of them preoccupied and away from defacing the main RD, at least. It's kind of annoying constantly rewriting it but we should try to hang on to it for as long as we can.Agreed. If it wasn't there, they would be after the artwork instead.I've been helping as much as I can but I have to head to bed. Good luck everyone!Why not do r/MLP?[](/gummystare)When I try checking the people behind some random wrong pixels it keeps referring me to people posting in r/mylittlepony. I think the visual doesn't catch up but when I manually check it gives me the author value for a fix I'm not yet seeing.Checking in Here Keeping up with the vandalism, but need sleep, time to change the guards?
[](/pegaguardconcerned)Perhaps we can try to add a sleepy Fluttershy in the pink heart just above RD, now that she is finished. Anyone game?

I'm not sure surrounding ourselves in blue would help at this point. [](/sp)

[](/ppfear) Also, have you seen what the blue border did to Pinkie Pie? It's leaking out her eyes now.People sure like placing random pixels on her left eye for some reason...

[](/rdsalute) Anyway, doing my part fixing it.[](/spikenervous) Hopefully enough of them respect art that they will.[](/fluttershh)Don't cover up any art though![](/goodjob) Great work everyone, and thanks to the folks who started to organize us!  We're currently among the top-tier pixel art in the /r/place imo! I'll keep working on the border and countering vandalism. [](/sp)

I love that you can look around the image and find a variety of dedicated fans for various subreddits: sports teams, shows, countries, games, memes, bands and books.  [](/soawesome-intensifies) Looks awesome!

I'll do my best to defend her. Yeah, it went down to 10 mins for me too. 

Is it disappearing soon? I remember the button was around for what felt like a month. [](/scootacheer) It looks so good!
[](/sp)
[](/sgpopcorn) Let's hope it lasts!!![removed][](/rdsalute)

Rest assured.

Though time flies, we'll fly faster.Greetings from /r/parahumans. We're trying to write the name of the author of the book we're promoting just below the black box. We're a small sub, we don't want any conflict. We won't enroach on your territory, all we ask is that we are allowed to expand to the unused space below it in peace.[](/ajhappy)Hey, i missed this whole event, but at least i put my pixel on that black space around RD. I feel proud.Dashies cutiemark is irritating my OCD, please add the dark blue stripe and make it more bolt shaped[](/rrdsalute)[Great job everypony!](http://imgur.com/w0ZWWQk) [](/sp)

So what now? (Beside keeping her ungriefed...) shell we try to complete the pinkie near the blue corner?
[](/flutternice) I just saw it. Now it's time for maintenance.Yes, officially recognized by road and latticethe heart inside a heart is a pedo symbol btw :! :/ so I'd avoid whoever did the inner heart[](/lunadash) Yesterday, construction. Today, defend Dash. Got it.I think I placed one pixel for this one. I was too busy fending off people from drawing dicks on my Charmander. Sorry boys.[](/ohcomeon)But her cutie mark isn't even finished! Literally unplaya- uh, unwatcha- er, unviewable?

Yeah, that's it! We can't stop now! Keep throwing those blocks, everyone! Dash vult, Dash vult, Dash vult![](/yellingarmor)We need more anti-vandals, stat!

Focus on the pixel art, worry about the text later!In the early hours there was "send nudes", a dickbutt, a Charmander with around 5 dicks (wut) and several small dicks spread around, just as one would expect. But now it seems like a lot of the users have joined different groups and intends to make more proper things.Any confirmation on this?[](/rdcry) Help! She is getting really vandalized! Please!Guys, please help to fight vandals. You don't want the final canvas to be with vandalized RD when this "place" thing ends, right?All in! No Sleep Allowed!

BTW, does anyone know how many minutes/hours until this ends?[](/rdsalute)So far, every pixel I've placed has been repairing poor Rainbow. 

The people surrounding us must love us. We're like the tanks drawing all the aggro. Need some help cleaning up the griefing! :([removed]Wasn't around for the original creation, but nice work everypony. Currently doing my part on maintaining pixels.[removed][deleted]r/Greenlattice is invading! Guys we need more

Also the Sans below us is trying to expand[](/rdsitting)Welp, missed most of this. But at least I can help with de-griefing.Join our cause, soldier!What about changing "ponies" to "r/mylittlepony"? Most other subs have their sub name by their drawing, and "penis" would no longer be a 5 pixel change.I like that idea, but someone would have to make a post about it.Allow sans his space on the background, he deserves it.[removed]oh god, the text is under constant attack. i've been fixing the O for like an hour, lol.exactly. please think before placing your tile.i am preserving the void around "blue speed"I vote in favor of us willingly blacking out the "Ponies!!" Header, given it is a waste of our coloured tiles.r/halo is attacking!
No, they can then cover the mess that is "penis!!!" For us[](/rarityyell) The cooldown is now 5 minutes.

FIVE MINUTES.

HOOOOOOOOOOOOLD![](/cheerteach)I'm inclined to agree. The vandals seemed to increase after the text was added.[removed]We're losing ground. Focus on the face, ignore the tail!Haha, oh well. All the help matters, regardless!The border is starting to get chipped away at.true, but don't let that distract you from our main goal!Stupid five minute delay... the timer should be going up not down.

SEMPER VIGILO

Edit: Actually after watching for a few minutes, lower timers seems to be in our favor for some reason. YAY new timer![deleted][deleted]I think were letting themwe can give the text space to r/halo to expand their Master Chief.Good point. Proceed!But, if we let /r/halo take it, then they might try to make a move and expand south.[](/discentia)I actually REALLY dislike the black background. It's dark and ill suited to the subject. Sure it makes it stand out, but so would a pristine 2-5 pixel white border that follows her contour. It spreads our defeders too thin, and seems a bit selfish to our neighbors like Sans. I mean seriously there no reason not to let them have that real-estate. Should someone go as an ambassador to some other subreddits and ask for some help to keep this art alive?[](/discentia)Don't give an inch! I'm not sure, maybe /r/Greenlattice? They seemed to be helpful before. Any other suggestions?[deleted][](/twismile)Yup. The whole thing is interesting. Looking at the timelapses offer a pretty cool view in to dynamics of large groups of people. Future historians could probably look at things like these to get an idea what was in people's heads at that era.

This reminds me of [the time 8channers discovered that ancient romans were shitposting.](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/926/744/93f.png)SHE'S BEING VANDALISED!!!
[](/noooo)
I would suggest that we merge backgrounds, but with Sans and Papyrus having black outlines, blue would be better. Shouldn't go near the yellow bit. All these vandals make it hard to do much of anything though.[deleted]Much of the subreddit discord group is in agreement that the Sans head is okay to expand in, though you might see resistance from uninformed people.Hey we gotta change the black background to get rid of the void vandals. We're gonna rainbow border instead. Start with an outline of purple then indigo then blue and then green etcThe point is to attract vandals to an easy-to-repair honeypot, rather than having people make a mistake on Dash. It seems like people are often making mistakes when trying to repair eyes and the like.**Here's a sneak peek of [/r/ainbowroad](https://np.reddit.com/r/ainbowroad) using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/ainbowroad/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all) of all time!**

Not to mention we're streched thinly enough as it is.What you mean? It's still there.Oh hey I made the one post on there.We're at the end of the list of works they're to leave be and go under [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ainbowroad/comments/62qek8/strategy_and_policy_update/)That and it's not really worth distracting griefers when we constantly have "PeNIES" over Dashie.now it says penis9[removed]The rainbow road is starting to creep on the left side. If we block it out heavily enough they should leave us alone and go around.We are already good with them and on their recognized art listdoesn't mean they will all follow. We should be careful in any case.[](/shiningpride)We need to commit all our available forces into anti-vandalism. We can't afford to keep splitting into side projects because it will spread us too thin. Our enemies are too many in number for us to divide our forces like this. I suggest that we do both and divide our teamwork on keeping RD and the text safe, and some of us helping create Fluttershy on the bottom right.Hey, just a diplomat from /r/parahumansplace here.  We're trying to respect our previous border, but other outsiders keep coming in and spreading our orange.  We will do what we can to keep y'alls rectangle in place!#VoidLife[](/awwyeah)Appreciate it friend!

I'll make sure to keep an eye on yours and make sure no one oversteps the border. Everyone abandon the Fluttershy project. We need to fix Dashie!
This is the current [strategy](http://i.imgur.com/l62kg16.png), guys. Fluttershy is dead, sadly.  Although the lack of fluttershy is disturbing, I came here expressly to upvote and help keep clean.Fortunately it looks like it's a little more stable now. There are even a couple additional features.

We can't give up though. The vandals could still strike at any moment!half the time when I try to swap colors it just places the pixel through the toolbarThe vandals seem to have subsided for the most part. This is a reddit thing anyway, so I see no reason to call for outside help.Ok, just putting it out there. If necessary we could rally the power of the entire fan-base. I'll defer to your judgement though.Been placing tiles fairly often. Liking the addition of the mane six, although the Celestia one is off-centered. Hope to add Cadence and Luna, although maybe we should have them every for every two of the mane six cutie marks, since there's only 3 "mane" alicorns?Flowers in the background time.

Edit: Whoops, time was way out of whack.I'm not sure if the people who keep adding dark blue to the cutie mark are trying to help out with the image, but if they are I wish they'd refer to the template before doing so.r/mlp does have a link to r/mylittlepony though.Yeah, that's the problem, the Discord has decided the template I posted is the one we are going with. At this point we have bots fighting with each other.We have a lot of bots and people keeping an eye on Dash. Rest easy, friend. The Lunar Guard has this in hand.We did it! Man. I'm sorry I ever doubted us. I don't know where this was being organized, but those look great now.I don't think anyone's trying to expand more anyways, we've just been maintaining and working in the same rectangle area all day now. Neighbors are all being nice as well so there's no reason to ruin it for all of us. 

The random single pixels and people messing with the ponies text are gonna happen no matter what, though, but at least they aren't an organized group.I was more talking about the text and the cutie marks, but I guess it is the same area anyways so...  
I wasn't suggesting that we expand into our neighbors, I guess that was how it sounded though.[](/raritydress) I think we should let it take one of our exclamation marks. Things might flow together nicely that way. We have other things to fight regardless.[Caught a rare untrolled Dashie!](https://s3.postimg.org/3m9e74k5v/Untitled.png)

EDIT: Mostly untrolled...Not to be a buzzkill, but her cutie mark has an extra pixel...http://imgur.com/HHujwoq

Here ya go, friend. An untrolled Dashie, plus perfect sign, and perfect Mane 6 cutie marks, Celestia, and Luna.[](/dashhfof) What's going on with her cutie mark?We're hoping that we can keep her pristine, regardless of final cutie mark shape. We may have a lot of people not active on the discord or the subreddit that are helping us keep her looking nice, and they won't be aware of the changed template. We'll see what happens!Thanks a ton for helping keep things going!Aah. Didn't know that was going on. That's smart. Definitely a better method of communication. Well, nice work, guys![](/raritysquee)Oooohh, pretty. What specs does it have?You do need to post Fluttershy's specs.../r/battlestablesThink I need one? Exactly.

I can see there's already a library, so I'll be watching your post and monitoring what you come up with.[](/rdsalute) We must protect her at all costs![I'm doing my part](http://youtube.com/watch?v=SMTz9nIUkGc)We're already removing many duplicated posts about this. We are keeping it contained so that it does not get out of control. Updated pastebin in the original comment and here: https://github.com/tea-drinker/saveDashie/blob/master/dashie.py

SorryYou look like you have a different websocket from me. What version do you have installed?Save the pastbin (right at the bottom of the original comment) as dashie.pyIf that was 3 minutes ago, I misclicked a pixel. As for what she's supposed to look like, this is the guide:

https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/83/27/83/832783dde19dc4984d018fc68d0308a0.gif[](/fluttercry) Could you _please_ put this up on GitHub or something? There's a whole bunch of improvements and corrections I'm making while in the process of trying to get this to run for me, and sending patches in Reddit comments is a _terrible_ workflow for doing software development. ;-P I'd much rather just send a few PRs for you to look over.https://github.com/tea-drinker/saveDashieThanks, I'll be sending some of my own improvements shortly.Isn't getting out of control half the fun of April fool's day?[](/twisad) It's quite sad that it gets continously attacked.[](/rdsalute) I'm doing my part!

*fixes another pixel*[](/rdsalute) I won't let our little angel be destroyed. I'll stay on the defensive.Be mindful of the [reference image!](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/83/27/83/832783dde19dc4984d018fc68d0308a0.gif)

The cutiemark and her tail are currently a bit malformed, though it's not obvious. Although the red in her cutiemark extending a pixel looks better, maybe we should keep that.&gt; &lt;Websocket URL from the devtools panel in your browswer&gt;

Which one is that?Eh, I don't know. The other picture is more of a "yay, look what we did" whereas this is more like "let's make sure this stays there". Lot's of useful content in the comments here...Same here:

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "dash.py", line 29, in &lt;module&gt;
        ws = websocket.create_connection(url)
    AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'create_connection'
    Process Process-2:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/multiprocessing/process.py", line 258, in _bootstrap
        self.run()
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/multiprocessing/process.py", line 114, in run
        self._target(*self._args, **self._kwargs)
      File "dash.py", line 16, in repaint
        if len(discord_list.keys()) == 0:
      File "&lt;string&gt;", line 2, in keys
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/multiprocessing/managers.py", line 755, in _callmethod
        self._connect()
    Yeah, the websocket-client installation did the trick.See above.If you open the devtools panel then refresh the page, the top item fetched (and the one that keeps getting data) should be listed as a type websocket. The URL should look like wss://ws-0fbfff362d5e970a9.wss.redditmedia.com/place?m=&lt;BIG LONG KEY HERE&gt;

I don't know what that key stands for or how it's generated but after a while mine started giving a 403 error and I had to replace it so I've just left it out of the script for you guys to find your own.U mean Fonies right? [](/hahaha "Ponies=Fonies")All words are particularly vulnerable to attacks, so maybe we should shorten it to "PONY"?I reckon that the time between placing pixels will over time become longer and longer, so make sure to use them to promote art. Even if there isn't anything wrong with Rainbow Dash, don't spend your pixel on something like delaying the black hole. Keep efforts focused, and work together!I held it together for 8 hours while farming in Conan Exiles. You pony nerds better not make it a waste

EDIT: Suggestion. Move PONIES to vertical space to the left of the tail in the open black space, let /r/halo expand their chief a bit.It's a copy of live data so what I got had some errors (sabotage!). I fixed what I could see and posted the results.Things are less then perfect at the moment. We need to pull some effort here.

edit: my suggestion is that as long as there is a lot of damage to the image itself concentrate on it, the text should be second priority and the backgound third.That sounds like a good order of priorities. Although some attention needs to be given to whoever's trying to write things along the bottom of the background.[](/shiningpride) All the artworks in /r/place are under constant attack. Some people are just assholes that want to see the world burn. But the fact that we have kept our image in such a good condition for so many hours says more about us than it says about them.We already have a post about this at the top of the /hot/ page so I'm removing this one for rule 4.Thanks. I wasn't aware of that module and was spending a lot of time messing with my own little JavaScript snippets. Should have known the Python community would have come up with something by now.

Now to figure out how to run this...Have you tried 

    pip install websocket-client

as opposed to just websocket?Where are you getting that dashie module from? It's not in PyPi.

    $ python SaveDashie.py
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "SaveDashie.py", line 3, in &lt;module&gt;
        import dashie
    ImportError: No module named dashie

    $ pip install dashie
    Collecting dashie
      Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement dashie (from versions: )

    No matching distribution found for dashie
    You are using pip version 8.1.1, however version 9.0.1 is available.
    You should consider upgrading via the 'python -m pip install --upgrade pip' command.

Edit: Nevermind, I see that's what the pastebin is.

Could you perhaps just put everything on GitHub or GitLab so we can just `git clone` to get the full code?OK, found it. Running it now.

Anyway, people will need to:

    pip install requests
    pip install websocket
    pip install websocket-client

It would be awesome if you could put place.py, dashie.py and dash.py on GitHub for easier downloads.Dashie is not a module, but the TXT file he posted... just a huge array.

https://pastebin.com/Ac2bKrAs

Download it and rename it to dashie.py.You are right: https://github.com/tea-drinker/saveDashieAlso `requirements.txt`, since this project also apparently has a few dependencies.Thanks for the template. I've spotted an error and I'll push a fix.Defend the pony!Sometimes... &gt;_&gt;Honestly, we should probably just erase "PONIES!" ourselves. It's just a waste of a energy at this point when we could be keeping Rainbow herself spot-free. Words are too open to attack, and how close the word is to a certain other word is causing visible problems.So THAAAAATS how it wasn't smelted.[](/derp) Honestly, it looked much better without that black rectangle.*Someone please review this and comment*

*Make sure someone you trust has commented to say this is ok before you run it*

It tracks vandalised pixels from the picture I posted and repairs one every ~~ten~~ eleven minutes. If pixels are repaired in the meantime then it won't try to re-fix them.

During testing it painted a pixel white when it logged that it'd be painting it blue. I don't know what caused it so I can't be sure I fixed it. But since then the tests have been ok.

edit: timer to eleven minutes to make sure it doesn't go off too early.

edit: get the code off git-hub : https://github.com/tea-drinker/saveDashie
I'm getting the error

    module 'dashie' has no attribute 'right'

I don't know much about Python, but it sounds like the raw image data you linked above should have 'right' defined but doesn't.  Is there a more up to date file, or am I doing something else wrong?Thanks[deleted]I don't know if dashie is correct or not... I keep getting more "Discord!"s than harmonizations, even from people like /u/dr_zorand who are tending to Dashie.

There are some weird people out there using tons of old zombie accounts, and they're constantly trying to fuck the picture up. Freaky.[deleted]You need the official reddit app for thatProblem areas: 

1. They are trying to modify "Ponies" into "Penis" 
2. There was an effort to draw either a penis or a turd coming from RD's back side.
3. There are some rogue members of /r/greenlattice who insist on invading. This is not the stance of the majority there. 
4. Random pixels on RD herself, especially her eyes. 
5. New: Seems to be red forming below her. Not sure what they're doing with that right now. No, it distracts them from attacking dash, it's a good buffer.[](/bonbon) GOOD POINT!Looks like something yellow and square is moving into the bottom right corner. Anybody know who's annexing the empty space?[deleted]Been defending her for the past 3 hours and I don't plan on stopping any time soon.The need for defense grows. Just took a look for the first time in an hour or so and "clop" was written clearly on the black, and the "ponies" at the top was clearly "peniss".These are the coordinates:

https://www.reddit.com/r/place/#x=773&amp;y=434[deleted][deleted]Ah ok, good. Cooperation is always good.[](/karmacute)Can we give up with the "ponies" at top, Or switch it to just "Pony" or something less easy to vandalize?

I feel like it just makes us a target, and it's constantly being vandalized.[deleted]They could easily drop a pixel in the middle. Just because they couldn't spell something doesn't mean they won't vandalize.That's kind of the point though. We would rather they vandalize the words rather than the picture.I understand that, but when the words are there it makes Rainbow Dash stand out more as a potential vandal target. Without the words, they're much more likely to go vandalize some other words or images.

On r/place the images that are just images with a border field are the least vandalized, while the ones with words are the most vandalized. The words stand out and bring more trolls than it deflects.[](/scootappeal)I'm sorry, but due to the fact that there is already a [very active thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/62qfpd/sleepy_rd_in_rplace_is_done_great_job_everyone/) about this topic, I'm going to have to remove this as a repost.[](/rdhuh)The cutie mark's bugging me? I feel like if it were a bit [more lightning shaped](https://imgur.com/a/zPOg1), it'd be a better representation.

Of course, since everyone's gone into full-defense mode, it's gonna be a bit hard to make any sort of edits.[deleted][deleted]We have few pixels to go around to make sure you're placing them properly! [](/twismile)[](/rdsalute) I'm on the job right now.Do you think we should the Sans at the bottom encroach a little? I feel that it would look neater to have the top of his head overlaid and outlined, than to constantly fight against him.Having the words up top gives them something else to vandalize other than our beautiful pony. Kind of like zinc attracts rust.Ah, yes, like a sacrificial anode. [](/b32)I think if it was just black above, or if we put something like "r/mlp" it might make it marginally more difficult to change one letter and make it offensive.

If it's just a little more difficult the vandals will go elsewhere.I'm not messing with the Sans head at all.  There's enough to fix.This has literally been most of my day.

[](/flutterkay-r) I live a slow and quiet life.Some tips:  
 - Make sure to check the ref that you're placing pixels in the right spot - let's not waste any pixels!  
 - Refresh the page before placing a pixel - it seems the canvas gets out of sync fairly easily  
 - Focus on the Dashie first, then text/background  
 - The Sans below us should be allowed to overlap - don't waste pixels there  
 - We are coordinating in the http://manechat.horse/ discord server, in the #mylittleactivities channel - feel free to join us![deleted]Ah. High school senior with no homework or job, here, so, same.Thanks to u/chipperpip the left eye has reappeared.Hah!  I don't watch the show much anymore, but I always thought that pixel art was cute.[](/rdsalute) I'm on it!I actually think it attracts vandals. Vandalizing a word is easy, an image is a little harder. If they can't easily do it, I believe they would go elsewhere.My job involves sitting in front of a computer and usually not having anything to do, which makes this really easy.I've been defending her cutie mark and left eye. So many vandalsA number of people in discord have let the Undertale people know that they can go ahead and expand in as needed (within reason, of course).I believe they are trying to make a fluttershyNot to poke things, but that thread implies that it's done and over with - it's not. This thread is about the upkeep of what's been built and trying to coordinate it's maintenance :P

We've been seeing the occasional mistake in pixel placement when working with areas of RD like the eyes, wings, cutie mark, and tail, which costs additional pixels to fix again.

Feel free to pick which one to maintain, but if you find yourself not busy with it go ahead and move to the other.[](/scootappeal)I'm sorry, but due to the fact that there is already a [very active thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/62qfpd/sleepy_rd_in_rplace_is_done_great_job_everyone/) about this topic, I'm going to have to remove this as a repost.[](/ppshrug) Nah. I feel like it'd get rid of a lot of the charm of the piece.

Besides, changing what it said just because other people changed it first is no fun. It's a lot more meaningful defending the word "ponies" than it is just folding and changing it to something generic/nothing at all.

The worst they're doing is changing it to say "penis".

[](/ppfear) Whoops! Forgot to set it off private. Should be good now.[deleted]Worm and MLP are by far my two favourite fandoms. Both of them excel in creating compelling characters. I wholeheartedly support this idea. [Undersiders](https://t4nky.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/my_little_undersiders__wildbow_is_magic_by_chromacurves-d7r5kr8.png). Good enough.

[Echidna though.](http://img04.deviantart.net/ee28/i/2016/237/9/b/my_little_echidna__wildbow_is_magic_by_chromacurves-dafa8zq.png)Indeed. Even though the discussion on those subs seemed to be willing to negotiate, /r/furry had a bunch of projects on the go in different places, and most of them went down (a bit like /r/undertale's earlier projects, and our initial Pinkie unfortunately).I like to think of ourselves as the MMO tank, taking all the aggro from the graffiti trolls so others can do their arts in (relative) peace.[](/rarityannoyed) What I don't understand is why didn't you collaborate on a spider with Straya. Because, you know, australia, giant spiders, makes sense? No?No kidding, but it's good! Been reading pretty steady since I posted.A long (but really very good) superhero story.

The protagonist has the ability to control and detect insects, in about a two-city-block radius around her. Other people have... other powers, often more suited for direct combat, and there's about twice as many supervillains as superheroes.Just checked, the final chapter was posted on November 19, 2013Worm is really good guys. There's an audiobook available too. These guys are good. Let's leave their banner be.the rainbow dash will inevitably fade into the abyss of randomly colored pixels anyways. just as pinkie pie fell to the blue corner. it's fine![](/louder) Not if I have anything to say about it.**Here's a sneak peek of [/r/place](https://np.reddit.com/r/place) using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/place/top/?sort=top&amp;t=year) of the year!**

Subreddits, no matter how small, that can decide on a central project to work on do better. Meanwhile, large subreddits that spread their efforts tend to collapse: I watched /r/furry lose a war to /r/touhou because they were shoring up two other projects completely distanced from each other at the same time.I'm on chapter 3.11 right now, taking brief breaks to check Dashy. Admittedly, I am an easy sell for this sort of thing. It reminds me of a darker version of *Please Don't Tell my Parents I'm a Supervillain*, which I also loved.So, whats WORM exactly?Just hopped over to your subreddit. Book sounds really good so I'm settling down for an evening of drinking tea, reading Worm and defending Dash.Awesome!I keep forgetting these bots pop up when the sub is mentioned :(. I find them a little annoying.&gt; settling down for an evening

or 30.  Worm is really, really long.[](/chrysalis) It's an epic (both length and scope) story about a girl with unconventional superpowers. The story is gritty, but smart with plenty of good worldbuilduing. What feels *really* good about this story is that the odds are always against the protagonist and the only tool she has is her wit.
[deleted][](/bonexcited)excellent news! but there are many many vandals with no allegiance at all... at least we have us to defend it!Welcome to those from /r/parahumans!

Did you know there's pony versions of the Slaughterhouse 9?

It's unrelated to the current topic, but I do enjoy both ponies and Worm, so it's amusing to see them combined like that.explanation [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/62w4yc/complete_worm_ad_on_rplace_plus_our_allies_from/dfprvkc/)

TL;DR it's a fantastic web serial about superheroes that you can read for free [here](https://parahumans.wordpress.com)There's finally an audiobook?! Yesssss!

I've given up a couple times because I just can't stand reading it in a web browser, but it's so good!There's actually a great Worm/MLP crossover on fimfiction, called A Friend in Need. INCREDIBLE WHERE SHOW ME PONY S9 PLEASEWell I found the website and it appears to be a fan-made production? I imagine an ebook would be easy to make, considering the original's format, but I assume Wildbow wants to do it right when they make an official ebook.

Do you know how long it's been since the story finished? I stopped at chapter 16 last time.Jeez, I didn't stop *that* long ago...Where's my motivation! Here and now with the audiobook, I guess! I can get through those at work.Where does the name of the sub come from? Are "parahumans" what the people with superpowers in the story are called? Fandom nickname?&gt;Where does the name of the sub come from? Are "parahumans" what the people with superpowers in the story are called?

TL;DR yes.

[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/62w4yc/complete_worm_ad_on_rplace_plus_our_allies_from/dfprvkc/) a better explanation for the story.[](/bonbon)good luck my guy!It's been holding surpisingly well; RD has mantained territorial integrity through most of the time on /r/place. I'd know because I spent a *lot* of time working on the beetle of "Read Worm" last night.yes i am surprised that our dash has lasted this long. we have a lot of dedicated guards!  
  
also, that beetle of yours looks very lovely!ah yes, that makes a lot of sense. one big sub, working on a relatively small thing will make it last for a long time! My brother has been swearing by Worm for awhile, I'll start chipping away tomorrow!
Holy crap no way [](/ajcower)Parasprites?? Where??You've already been linked, but I figure you might be able to help us find other Worm-themed pony stuff for /r/thereisponyofit.

EDIT: [Found it](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/#x=382&amp;y=605). Very sneaky, I like it[](/berryapproved)I'm a Linux nerd. If Dashie doesn't need defending then I'm helping Tux!
[](/rrdsalute)It might just be the [script](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaveDashie/comments/630jsj/python_script_to_protect_dashie_from_vandalism/) messing up.

Edit: It also doesn't help, that they can't decide whether they want the blue eye or not.It does look nice, we went with this 3x3 design for shear simplicity and low maintenance.The script ignores that area, the transparent area in their PNG are skipped over when it goes through.It took about 2 hours discussing it and 2 votes of 12 different options, the python script maker even updated their image to add it, so we're going ok so far.[](/bonbon)Glad to hear it! It seems like either the attacks have slowed down, or we're really holding steady. We'll definitely be ready when this thing ends!Hooray! I'll even subscribe! But yeah you guys should really change the color, it looks like PNE!![](/twismile) Thanks! Well, it's been changed two or three times already.Ah, it's a reference to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Balthazar), it seems.[](/rdhappy)The vandals seem to have slowed down now. We're doing great. With all that space you already own why are some of your members on insisting on MLP art between /r/undertale's Sans/Papyrus?  Correct. The first Croatian production cartoon, I believe.We've added your suggestion, everyone preferred it.

Please visit /r/SaveDashie for template updates[](/fluttercry) Wow, you're right.[](/ppshrug) I don't think there is an official /r/mylittlepony discord.[](/cutealoo)Now we gotta make sure it stays safe! We're cementing our place in history![](/simplyrose-d)

 This explains the battle between alternating text colours and solid text.Awww Honey, it's been vandalized like that 100+ times and been promptly fixed. But I'm glad you're proud of yourself &lt;3The Elements of Harmony http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/mlp/images/3/38/Elements_Of_Harmony_2_S01E01.png/revision/latest?cb=20121231014615

That would be kind of awesome! OH I'm dub. Thanks!The intensity of attacks has dwindled significantly compared to 24 hours before.[](/hmmm) Does anyone know who's making the big bull symbol to our top right? It occasionally tries to expand into us.I found out from /r/halo that it's /r/cowchop. The person I spoke to was friendly enough. They know who we are at least.

Also, I think one of ours is trying to build a fourth exclamation mark, so they may just be pushing back to defend their territory.

What I want to know is who the chemist with the beard is to our right. 'Baltazar' or something.

He's barely been touched by vandals, but someone changed the name and I have no idea what their template is or even who they are to help them out.I think it'd be great if anytime she doesn't need repairs, watchful builders could contribute their pixels to fighting the void that is growing to the southeast of Dash. It's already started swallowing other people's pixel art.

 If you don't know the exact pattern to repair a piece damaged by it, you can always dump some color in its center or around the edge to slow its momentum. 

Funny story, spent all afternoon editing an offline version of r/place without realising it.  I had completely cleaned up the old version of ponies.  When I opened it on my phone everything was completely different and I was all awww my hard work :([](/flutterkay)[Am I the only one who thinks her tail colors could be curved more smoothly?](http://imgur.com/a/2K4Ls)

I'm clocking out for the night keep up the good fight. No, what I meant was, I'm seeing these grid-type things in lots of communities that are being used as guides, and they all appear to have been made with the same tool. /r/tf2 has used one, I've seen a guide for /r/placestart and a few others.I wouldn't be surprised if the Linux guys have their own script, since it's such a set-in-stone design that wouldn't need any updating.Why does the blue tip of the tail go down so far?  It looks awkward and prevents Sans from being able to have the top of his head.I am coming... it won't say ponies anymore muahahah!Thanks :)We are going all pink for readability reasons http://i.imgur.com/Pfa3F43.png

[](/colgate) Totally normal.You guys rock!I saw this too, but as I mentioned there is some running a script that would overwrite it. I'll see what others think about itYeah, I don't know who keeps chopping off the top of Sans head, but it's been happening since the black background was added. I started off defending Dashie, but I end up spending most of my pixels maintaining Sans because either bronies or voiders keep deleting him. Incidentally, if you watch the time lapse for Dashie being put together, it becomes clear that Sans &amp; Papyrus were there first... kind of a dick move to spread the black out over him.Now I feel bad for trying to return the cutie mark to its previous incarnation for 20 minutes [](/facehoof)Rarity's cutiemark is wrong though. I've seen it being flipped between this and the template version all day. A lot of pixels wasted there.You'll be happy to know we modified to be more readable, it'll be a solid color using the lighter of the two colors currently in it.

Please visit /r/SaveDashie for template updatesI'm seeing what looks like an effort to turn the purple letters pink, and it doesn't seem to be done by vandals, but others are reverting it. Is this a change we want? We're losing some effort working at cross purposes.Yes, we've got a new version of the template now http://i.imgur.com/4p48Yk3.png

It includes fixes to the hair, trixie on the right and more readable letters, I'm going to ask about reposting the new one. The old letters some people had difficulty reading.What site is everyone using for these templates?Newest template is at r/savedashie[](/sunsetshimmer-r)

Hey guys, I couldn't help but notice that Sunset didn't make it onto the poster in Place.  I figured I'd find a place for her though, and I think I have just the spot.

I'm using a Python script and [this image](https://i.redd.it/69srs53ukapy.png) for this.  There's a tutorial here (sorry about their crazy CSS): https://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/62wqjx/rplace_python_script_tutorial/

I'm using the image above at top-left coordinates 867, 530.

This is of course a modified version of this emote: 

[](/ssidle-r)

If you can't get it to work, check for a solution in the [original thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/62sn70/i_created_a_script_to_place_pixels_according_to/) 

The place on the canvas I'm shooting for is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/#x=867&amp;y=530) if you want to place a pixel manually or check on progress.

Thanks for any help you provide!

Edit: [Here's the pixel-gridded image.](https://i.redd.it/0wjwn3e08bpy.png)[](/flutterpaint) After many hours discussing small changes and details and voting on them at Manechat #mylittleactivities discord chat(https://manechat.horse/), the newest template we have agreed to is here. The cutie mark is redone, the EoH is by PONIES, 3 "!", the Mane 6 and their sister princesses are at the bottom. The cutie mark may not work out as a script exists that will currently revert it.

**UPDATED VERSION** http://i.imgur.com/Pfa3F43.png

If you do not know what /r/Place is, it is an April Fools/experiment/something by reddit, you may place a single pixel on a 1000x1000 canvas every 5 minutes(currently) if your account was made before this started.

You are under no obligation to follow the template, but coordination is key in this. [](/dashheart)

EDIT: Please visit /r/SaveDashie for template updates, post updated with newer version.[](/spikewtf) They should've just done the entire piece as Spike. He's best pony AND best princess. [](/rarishock) Can't be that good since he is getting covered by Twilight. coordinates: https://www.reddit.com/r/place/#x=773&amp;y=434

current pixelimage: http://i.imgur.com/glJGiG6.pngIf I could make any suggestion, I think the text should be a lighter color. Currently when zoomed out, the O, I, and S are almost impossible to make it from the black background. Making them a lighter color (the coat colors of the mane 6 and CMC, maybe) would look better 

I am colorblind though, so maybe it's just me on having difficulty reading it. One of the seven wonders of equestria [deleted][deleted]it's still poopin itself!![deleted]You're under no obligation, but helping keep neighbors and allies (like BerryTube's Berry Punch artwork) vandalism-free is probably a better use of your pixels than vandalism.[](/ppshrug)

Hey, I help where I can, fixing stuff has been my priority so far. But I'm not exactly on good terms with the socialist/communist user base and this is a nice way to annoy them.I propose this:
http://imgur.com/a/AHUAX
But I suppose it's a bit late for any big changes.
[](/whattheflut)It is a bit hard to read the PONIES, but it might be harder to change it at this point, we struggled to get just the few pixels changed for the cutie marks and the script some people use works top to bottom so it'd be reverted quickly. So I don't know what we can do about it, the maker of the script can update his template ~~but it won't change those already running it~~ script now auto updates.

I can bring it up though and see what other say.
The word ponies does get vandalized a lot. It shouldn't be too hard to just change the letters to the new color when they get vandalized. Only issue is people not knowing the change. [deleted]Just checked out the Undertale sub since they're encroaching a bit.

Any chance we could let Sans' head into the picture?  It just needed one more layer (I think) and won't cover anything important.  It will avoid an unnecessary border war, and I'm sure they'd be willing to help protect Rainbow Dash in exchange for the little extra space \^_\^We have voted and we are changing the color! All in on the light purple. If you mean the hourglass, the discord we're coordinating on was unaware of it. Something magical I've noticed about this; a lot of trolls seem to want to vandalize both the text and Dashie, but we have all mainly focused on keeping Dashie unsullied. Says a lot about our community - we don't care about being called names (Fonies, Penies, Penis, etc.) We mostly care about the characters! [](/raritywut)So, what's the status on the right border? I'm noticing some green seeping in? How aggressively are we going to defend this or did we negotiate something I'm unaware of? Oh whoops, I thought you guys were going all pink on the letters. I'll have to remember to look back at this pattern when doing random correctionsOh cool, so I was helping xDhttp://imgur.com/a/coqgXIt worked, cutie mark is changed :)We should place sunset and glimglams mark somewhere.[](/sbstare)

Huh, for once there's no vandalism to fix.

[](/sp)

[](/sneakybelle)

Means I can use the time to vandalize the communist propaganda!Often times the grief is fixed but not yet updated, so checking the user's name returns the one who fixed it. So make sure to refresh before checking and it should work. Also why it's good to refresh before placing a pixel.[](/cutealoo) As long as they attack the text and not the pony, it's good. We need your effort, keep the griefers distracted.Well, if you're a fan you're technically in the community, so welcome to the Mane Sub, friend.Sans for a while had a white line in our border and everyone seemed ok with it, but I think at one point they adjusted it to go outside it to avoid issue, I haven't see much attempt to recreate the line.For just a single moment, it was complete. https://imgur.com/a/HQX5p[](/rdsalute) I shall continue to defend her!Canadian checking in, if Dashie's not in danger, I'm helping maintain the canadian flag over on the other side of Rainbow Road.We need more people to correct it!We have a few bots maintain it, it will quickly be reverted.Hijacking the top comment to mention that we have a [new template](http://i.imgur.com/zAsqmKA.png)!  
The text is now all pink, Celestia's cutie mark was changed and there was a minor change in RD's mane in the top right.

Visit us in #mylittleactivities on the [Mane Chat Discord server](http://manechat.horse/) for future discussion, or keep an eye on /r/SaveDashie/new for updates.Is that an official /r/mylittlepony discord?I now visited /r/Place and feel that I don't fully understand it aside from being a group art project based on pixels.

But this cool.It's the closest we have, but it is not official.Whoeps, was getting rather annoyed people kept changing the Celestia cutie mark, now I get it. Sorry folks, guess I was annoying some people myself :P No, [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/tTGJXlj.gif) is an official /r/mylittlepony discord. What's the symbol at the top left?[](/rdsitting) The elements of harmony! Thank you! I truly am.I've been spending all my pixels defending Dashie, but now that the vandals have mostly stopped I don't know what to do! I guess I could help out Solaire?Don't worry, those things haven't really shown up since season 1.You guys think you could help /r/fivenightsatfreddys? "The void" is taking over and we barely have anyone to help.I *love* the mane 6 at the bottom.I've been attempting for a while, each time it's automatically gone the next moment.Yeah. To be honest by the time I find the spot again I feel like it could have changed. My PC is also reaching the end of it's life, so it crashes on em a fair bit. I'm lucky if I can place most of the time, so I just focus on what I can do.I know this was from 13 hours ago and that I have no idea how much longer the canvas will stay for, but thank you so much. 
I think I speak for everyone at /r/mlp when I say we promise to also keep /r/halo's drawing in perfect condition.

Could you possibly supply us with a picture of the grid plan (if you guys made one) for your drawing so we know exactly how it should look, because I see see some weird pixel on the top right of it and want to know how it should look exactly.I still think the orange strand is too lumpy/r/halo is getting vandalized, time to help them outThere's a grid [right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaveDashie/comments/632y2h/updated_template_one_color_text_celestias_cm/)You're not understanding what I'm asking. I'll get my answer elsewhere eventually.So are we officially referring to *this* as "The thing, at the place?"[](/scootacheer)Oh hey, I remember mentioning her cutie mark needed a rework, but I was told it wouldn't be possible to coordinate that this late. Great to see that we're still gonna try! And it looks great too! It has the blue tile and a lightning shape, just like I wanted!

Let's keep it up, all! We can do this![](/colgate) Wow, this is the first april fools I've actively participated in. I've been defending Dashie, the Hungarian flag to our north-west and our neighboring artworks all day. Also been spying around, to make sure nobody's planning any sort of shady business.

[](/sp)

[](/flutterfear) I need some help though. The pony and the Hungarian flag are fine, but our skeletal neighbors from /r/Undertale keep getting their faces drawn all over. Somebody's trying to expand our black border inside Sans' head. It's entirely possible some people are trying to make people attack us, but if it's one of you, then please stop it.

Defend Dashie and her neighbors!It's made from people in /r/Croatia. 
Oh? Thanks!

Now I know what it's [supposed to look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/croatia/comments/62x1nq/we_did_it_hreddit/). Seems it is being actively maintained as well, that error I noticed was fixed quickly.Aha, I tried that to see if I could find some of griefers, but I ended up with bronies half the time, so I wasn't sure how reliable it was \^\^.I'm not part of this community, but i love the show and i love the picture and came here to say this.Non-Mobile link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law

^(This is a bot | )[^Info](/r/mylittlepony/comments/1lwzub/deviantart_imgur_mirror_bot_nightmirrormoon/)^( | )[^(Report problems)](/message/compose/?to=meditonsin&amp;subject=NightMirrorMoon)^( | )[^(Source code)](https://github.com/meditonsin/NightMirrorMoon)Gotta view that 4k source file for them details to appreciate it :P This one took about 37 hours. A lot of that time was spent on setting up proper perspective and proportions; spent extra time too on the manes. While Im sure I couldve done better on each thing individually, the focus this time around was to spend effort on the picture as a whole to make the whole thing look proper, fitting, and uniformly detailed so as not to be uncanny. 

Learned a lot about this piece; like how much of my time is spent fiddling on backgrounds &gt;.&gt; I'm willing to bet that if I spent more time on ponies with less background that I'd be significantly faster and be better at drawing them; but these background pics are what people have the cravings for right now for commissions

I think I'm gonna take a step back now that I pushed my background work this far; spend more time on ponies in simpler scenes and work on fluidity and expression now. 

I couldnt have gotten this far if it werent for my sponsors on patreon &lt;3 It's come a long way since I started doing this full time and I hope it can keep improving! Thanks to all you guys too for the uplifting comments and encouragement, it helps make it all worth it and gives me the drive to keep going![](/scootacheer) Looks astonishing![](/spikeapproves)Your perspective game is on fleek!

[](/rooh)Want a suggestion, though?That title is somewhat fitting...May I ask how you first got into drawing? Was it some formal education or did you start with youtube videos or something? SPACE PONIES[](/rsgpopcorn)[](/twibeam)Boldly go where no ponies have gone before!
[](/sp)
[](/karma)Except all the aliens we find are all still pony shaped with different horns!Sure why notThank you gamey :D [](/rdsquishyface)So in love with your OC!Hehe glad im not the only one!np!Thank you! [](/flutteryay)[](/rhuhhuh)1-point perspective is nice, but you should try doing multi-point perspective—you could have easily done 3-point perspective for this piece!Ah, _waaay_ off to the left!  Well kudos then!Yeah from doing my studies, scenes where the subject is close up like this benefit from further points of perspective because closer, on-screen perspectives tend to negate proper sizing and proportions when looking at smaller depths of field (At least from what I can tell.) Otherwise it'd throw off the planet and it wouldnt look as big, plus the ship would look wonkey since it's longer than it is wide hehe[](/pinkieawe)This is amazing.


[](/awwyeah) It was haaaaaard but fun to draw &lt;3Very awesome! The way you draw the hair and eyes are really beautiful. Could we by chance see something that you did when you were first starting out? I'd love to see the progression!

Either way I really like your stuff and would love to see an actual story come out of this world you're creating! Keep it up and I'll keep an eye out for your next piece.

Is there any social media I could follow you on to keep updated? Twitter?Thanks LD! [](/bonbon)[](/aj27) In spaaaaaaaceThis is two point perspective; first point is at the end of the hall, 2nd point is way to the left -- I never use 1 point perspective, way too boring lol https://i.imgur.com/UOrdfrH.png[deleted]Oh wow, that looks amazing. Is there a story behind the scene? Looks like some time traveling space odyssey. Yeah, it's set in an alternate universe (Star citizen themed) and this is The bow-pone's first time in space; Lyra and Twilicorn are also aboard this exploration vessel searching for new habitable worlds. This one has humans on it, which are being scanned on lyra's screen :PThe hair and the eyes and the expression of the left mare gets me. I love this.im dead[](/ppawe-intensifies) It came out amazing! You're welcome to, we *are* a show subreddit after all.[](/sgpopcorn)I've been meaning to read it for a while now. This seems like as good an excuse as any.i gotta say i never thought i would say this but if someones simply comments on this that they will try worm and tell me what episode to watch. i will try my little pony AND give my honest thoughtsI was reading it for about 4 hours last night. Only reason I stopped is that I couldn't keep my eyes open any longer. I'd say it's worth a shot.ehh im gonna watch one of the two parters and then another episode from a later season. Awesome! Sorry if I started you out on a bad episode, I'm really not sure what a good place to start is, and I remember some people saying the first two episodes are like a pilot and those usually aren't as good as the rest of a show... but yeah, nice to see you didn't have a terrible time watching it. I'm up to 3.4 "Agitation" right now on Worm, it's pretty good!I'm from the Worm subreddit, if I start watching, should I post up threads on my personal reactions for a few episodes? I've always wanted to start, I just never heard much incentive before.I'd definitely be willing to read Worm, from what I've heard it sounds interesting, although I haven't heard much. You're in for quite a ride. [](/discrazy)I promise I'm gonna try out Worm. Season 1 episode 11 "Winter Wrap Up" seems like a good episode to start off with. If you want proof I've tried out Worm in the future, ask me a few questions about it and I'll be happy to answer!sounds like a deal im going to watch it soon and leave my thoughts as i watchI like the idea. Already planning on reading it!I mean, I already planned to give Worm a shot after this...I'm definitely down. For a place to watch the episodes, I'd throw them at [yayponies](https://yp1.yayponies.no/videos/episodes.php). A few good starting episodes are Hurricane Fluttershy, Return of Harmony, and Wonderbolts Academy (although I'm clearly biased).Those sorts of posts DO tend to get a lot of Karma...

Oh, wow! Thanks so much, stranger!!
Geez. If I wasn't dead-broke, I'd gild this.

This is *amazing.* I love these ideas--heck, most of these seem like they deserve full campaigns unto themselves!

I especially like the idea of the Pie Sisters--reminds me a little of the Fates from Greek/Norse mythology. 

Thanks again!!!You wanting suggestions for powers and abilities for the champions as well, or just characters we think would be suitable chief acolytes? 

Sun Queen - Sunset Shimmer. Long thought to have been banished from Equestria, she returns empowered with the fire of the Sun Queen herself to give warmth and succor to her attendants.

Blaze - [Wildfire](http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Wild_Fire). Engulfed in the flames of war, with blazing speed she brings death to those who stand in the way of her goddesses will.

Moon Princess - Trixie LulaMoon. Empowered to dream walk and watch over the adherents of the Moon Princess in both the sleeping and waking worlds.

Night Mare - [Night Glider](http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Night_Glider). Her very presence is enough to instill irrational fear and awe in the followers of Night Mare. Empowered to visit waking nightmares on adversary and ally alike, she can send her followers into berserk rages in battle as they strike out at phantom terrors, or reduce even the staunches of champions to a quivering mass of cowardice.

Unspoken - [Screwball](http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Screwball). Her very presence seems to warp the world around her immediate vicinity, causing the laws of the world to groan and strain in her presence as she goes about an unknowable and unfathomable mission. Hers is perhaps the most powerful blessing, although her very nature makes the true extent of that power uncertain.

Princess Luminace - Starlight Glimmer. First student of Princess Luminace, already powerful, her mastery of magic is now unrivaled among mortals, and only other Divine Champions pose any true threat to her might.

Lashtada - Shining Armor. Truly it is said that there is no pony who more fervently loved Lashtada than her consort Shining Armor. Elevated to near godhood while his mistress yet lived, Shining Armor's power now fades with her passing, but he is still a formidable demigod and icon of Lashtada's cult.

Soft Whispers - Marble Pie, Maud Pie, and Limestone Pie. Unlike Lashtada, when Soft Whispers died the power of her acolytes only increased. Maud found her younger sisters were also blessed by their goddess, and the three now share the burden of that power. Maud holds the power of entropy, able to seemingly speed up time to rot and decay both organic and inorganic matter. Marble holds the power of Stillness, able to seemingly stop time, stilling the beating heart in your chest and snatching away your breath, but also able to use this ability to preserve and protect under certain circumstances. Limestone received the most violent gift, able to forcefully rip anything apart, leaving no barrier capable of barring her and no prison capable of containing her, as well as making her an unmatched physical threat. It is thought that eventually one of the sisters will become the new Goddess of Death in time. Marble thinks it should be Maud, Maud thinks Marble has the most potential, and Limestone thinks it should be herself. Any conflict that might arise between the sisters is set aside, however, to deal with outside threats.

I was going to go with just Marble Pie on the last one, but I thought it would make sense that a 'dead' death god would only grow stronger, and it would be cool if all three of Pinkie's sisters could share that role.Yup, I was certainly thinking of the Norns from Norse mythology when I was thinking about the pie sisters in such a role. (They have a great color scheme for it too, along wit the sisterly bond.)

[](/wahaha) I'm just glad you liked my choices! Hope it helps!

Enh; the Unspoken from the last campaign was basically Khorne, and now he's more properly Discord. I'm tempted to leave it be. 

I was thinking something above and beyond a high priest for these Divine Champions, actually--something like the relationship between Grand Moff Tarkin and Darth Vader. IIRC, the Grand Moff actually outranks Vader in the chain of command (Hence, why he can order him around), but everyone knows it's Vader you need to be afraid of).

I was debating making the Divine Champion of Moon Princess [the evil paladin from the last campaign](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5s1s83/how_do_i_make_a_villain_sympathetic_simple_beg/), now an archangel of sorts. Any thoughts?

Oh, and thanks for the Shining Armor suggestion. I hadn't thought about making him a Champion for the Sun Queen...(One of u/brokenimage321's players here) shouldn't we list the Unspoken as dead and replaced in our canon, too? It has been a couple decades.

Shining Armor jumps out at me as a good candidate, either for the Sun Queen or Lashtada. And there was a high priestess for the Moon Princess in our last campaign, so that might be an option.

Not sure I follow that logic.  Isn't it a custom front-end?You have to write it as a disk image, not a file.Does this have a functional version of a decent web browser?  I could screw with this for a while for giggles.You don't need Debian/Ubuntu to install it. It's a bootable ISO. You just "need" Debian/Ubuntu to build it from source code, probably because that's the developer's own environment.

The short version is that with the right build chain, you could build it from any OS, but this is a very non-trivial chore (even just between *NIXes), especially for something as complicated as an OS. This is just a pet project for the developer; at this point in time he's simply not invested in making it buildable by anyone other than himself. Note that he says he doesn't recommend trying to build from source, even on Debian/Ubuntu.[](/rdhuh)Can I run blender on it?[](/rdsitting)I've got it running in a VM and I can safely say that you can use it for ponies.PonyOS is based on [ToaruOS](http://toaruos.org/), and appears to be Unix-like.

Quote: "The Toaru kernel provides a basic Unix-like environment. The kernel uses a hybrid modular architecture, with loadable modules providing most device driver support. The core kernel includes support for Unix pipes and TTYs, a virtual file system, multitasking, ELF binary support, and various core platform features on x86 systems.

Modules provide support for disk drives, ext2 filesystems, serial, keyboards and mice, a /proc filesystem similar to the one found in Linux, as well as an expanding collection of other device drivers."You need a Debian host to build it, probably for some tools common to that family of operating systems.  You don’t need one to install an existing binary.  Assuming POSIX compliance, you could probably bootstrap it, but this may well not be confirmed,[](/sneakybelle) Seems like a good time to promote /r/mylittlelinux for any Linux users in this thread (I know, the author was clear their work isn't based on a Linux kernel).

**edit**: [](/clop34-r) Huzzah! Three new subscribers!It's days such as this I'm glad I have an old laptop that I never use.Super excited about this. I was actually looking into playing around with PonyOS the other day.   
   
My only question is how to go about making a bootable USB. Do I mount the ISO with something like Rufus? Text editing, at least.Playing Quake, apparently.It's really more of a joke than a serious project.

The actual software behind this is called ToaruOS, an operating system written largely by a single person. Every year on April fools' day, they take the latest release of Toaru and slap on an altered theme and some pony-related stuff and then release it as a new version of PonyOS.who knows, maybe it will get a little girl somewhere interested in programming?23MB .iso is really impressive, without all the usual bloat, a custom OS can be really small and functional. It could be more useful if they used SUSE Studio to build this I guess...[](/rdsitting) Will it make my cpu run 20% cooler?It's not a shell, it's not a skin, it's not a Linux distro, it's not an Unix port... it's an actual custom operating system for x86 - with ponies.[](/twiponder) So, what can I use it for?I don't get it. It's not a Unix port, but it is based on Unix, right? Cause the main page describes it as "Unix-like." Or was it actually built from scratch? And if so, what makes it Unix-like?But, why?

Like yeah it's kinda neat I guess, but it seems really pointless.[](/spikeapproves)I do like where this is going. I may load it into a VM and see whats what.[](/sp)[](/twiponder)toaruos, [link here](http://toaruos.org) on which it is based, looks to be a one man operation that gets help from time to time. Have to give him props for continuing to develop the OS on his own. I don't think Id have stuck it out for as long as he has. Ill stick to ponifying my linux distros which rotate out depending on what mood Im in, mostly Debian or Red Hat based. Been toying with Arch but thats been kicking my ass.[](/sp) (On a completely unrelated note, there is a distinct lack of additional Octavia emotes. Surprised none were lifted out of Ep. 100)I am happy that the parent project is fond of the Railgun. &gt; But, why?

[](/magic) Ponies.Pretty sure you just drop the ISO onto the disk. However, the page mentions requiring a "PS/2 keyboard and mouse" which makes no sense cus those were discontinued completely around 2000.[](/cutealoo)You're either fond of the Railgun or wrongIt would have many of the same features design decisions as \*NIX and \*NIX-like operating systems.  Also, an operating system doesn’t have to be a fork of AT&amp;T-UX to be a \*NIX OS, it just has to be in compliance with the [Single \*NIX Specification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_UNIX_Specification).Non-Mobile link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_UNIX_Specification

I am afraid I will have to remove this as a Rule 3 violation.Crap, I thought it was good being part of the fandom.  No worries.  I'll repost later to the lounge.  The title/idea of this post reminded me of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddgn0C1Xs1A&amp;list=PLycU4rLiK___FrpilB7t3fihAFGVhpcCj&amp;index=3)It refers to a game that has little to no post launch support. But this isn't the place to ask for a patch.[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/#x=780&amp;y=380)

Edit: The Halo thread opposing the [FixMCC](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/632mm2/a_bunch_of_entitle_children_are_vandalizing_our/) text has zero upvotes, while "FixMCC" is the top [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/62ze3l/we_gotta_band_together_and_keep_the_chief_on/) on the thread about maintaining the Halo image. 

I feel like we're being roped into the unpopular side of a civil war. As a member of both fandoms, i'll throw in some of my pixels to help.Respectable.[](/rdsalute) On it good sir![](/ajfrown) What's FixMCC?Yeah, that makes it easier for others. :)I've been trying to help but unless your community can come to a consensus on whether they want it to be there I don't think I can continue contributing. You guys need to resolve this before asking us for help.Sure, no prob.[](/hmmm) I see. Well as long as it's trolls and it ain't nothin' worth keeping around I don't see why we can't pitch in.The Halo community is a very torn one, I would say it is 50/50 pro fix mcc, then anti mcc. I am one of the Anti ones, but I don't think it is right to continue to create a bad image and rep for our community as a whole.

Edit: And that thread did go about stating their opinion in a very belittling way.Thank you.Thanks for helping anyway, we are making progress, the reason why I asked is because the people doing it are the ones that rip on the devs every day. They do not support the game, they just tear it down.Nonetheless, I don't think it's right to rope people into a fandom controversy they have no stake in. If there are Halo fans on this sub with a stance on the issue, by all means fight away, but I already saw comments on the board about not wanting to waste effort and time on infighting, and personally I agree with that, and don't want to be part of the infighting of a fandom I'm not even part of. 

Also, judging by the word "Fix MCC" there, in mostly good condition, it seems like the sub already leans toward a concensus and I feel like the vandal removing pixels.Nvm, I understand[](/twiponder)Yeah, sorry OP. I'm one of these people. MCC is what finally killed all my faith in Microsoft in regards to the Halo franchise. I'd been willing to put up with a lot of shit, but MCC was a serious hot garbage fire on *launch*, and is apparently still almost exactly as bad.

[](/sp)

[](/twiright)I won't help the "Fix MCC" faction, but I won't stop keeping an eye on Rainbow Dash to help the other side either.

[](/twistare)Damn that was a weird sentence.It is a waste of time at this point, people keep repairing it and enough people like it to just leave it in. sorry for bothering you guys.[](/twiright) "There's always a bigger fish."Funny coincidence:  My grandfather used to love that saying, but for some reason he'd always replace fish with "gross yet somehow adorable spider-pony"[](/nmm)[Imgur mirror](http://imgur.com/a/ZbjYe)

Hey guys, I couldn't help but notice that Sunset didn't make it onto the poster in Place.  I figured I'd find a place for her though, and I think I have just the spot.

I'm using a Python script and [this image](https://i.redd.it/69srs53ukapy.png) for this.  There's a tutorial here (sorry about their crazy CSS): https://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/62wqjx/rplace_python_script_tutorial/

I'm using the image above at top-left coordinates 867, 530.

This is of course a modified version of this emote: 

[](/ssidle-r)

If you can't get it to work, check for a solution in the [original thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/62sn70/i_created_a_script_to_place_pixels_according_to/) 

The place on the canvas I'm shooting for is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/#x=867&amp;y=530) if you want to place a pixel manually or check on progress.

Thanks for any help you provide!I wouldn't do it man.  It'll get taken down as there's basically no open space anymore[](/pinkiepout)On the one hand I feel using scripts really takes away from the experience of r/place, but on the other hand, at this point there's no way to compete for space without them.It would be helpful if You included the image in gridded form so people would know where to place a pixel if they wanted to help out.My view on scripts is that it's perfectly okay, necessary even, to defend artwork using a script and a template. However, I think the creation of new art should be organic if possible.The spot I'm working on doesn't really have anything in it, but others are definitely trying to do something there.Good point.

[Here it is!](https://i.redd.it/0wjwn3e08bpy.png)Good luck to you on it.Yep, that's pretty much the conclusion I came to.How about Snowy Squish the Classy for Rarity?

In other news, I would seriously consider paying cash monies for Rarity-shaped marshmallow Peeps. Serious consideration applied in equal proportion to learning how to make marshmallows at home so I can mold them into Pony shapes.

They probably weren't even updated for the latest desktop version of Firefox though.Try Relay for Reddit if you're on Android, it's the only app that supports the entire gamut of emotes AFAIK.

I'm not sure if there's a solution on iOS though.[deleted]Firefox for Android supports the BPM extension (and thus displays all emotes).That's pretty neat!

"I AM a big pony"

-apple bloom↓this one is the lens I have

AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR 

http://www.nikon-image.com/products/lens/nikkor/af-s_dx_nikkor_18-55mm_f35-56g_vr/a big pony means that collage is difficult than I expected:(Что значит панельные "шоколадки"?Ой, я думал ты русский :)

На фотографии так называемый "панельный дом" - то есть не из кирпича и не на монолитном каркасе, а из бетонных панелей. Почти все новые дома, которые строились в советских городах 60х по 90е, были такие, панельные.

Когда я был маленький, мы жили напротив дома почти как на твоей фотографии, и мне эти коричневые квадратики напоминали шоколадку :)Don't tell me that building on the right is a residential one?I checked Google Map and find the word "Общежитие, МГТУГА", so it's surely dormitory of universityОй, what's a coincidense:)
I also like "Речной вокзал" near by this park.I was making a joke. You're standing in Japan while taking pictures of Russia, right?

[](/ppboring)Your camera has an impressive zoom lens.Thank you for your comments!!
I'm so happy!!
and actually, I'm not russian, but Japanese:)maybe residential one.Most likely. 

Some type of Soviet Brutalism.Haha! I know this place! My friend lives nearby.

[Here's the panorama on Google maps of the place](https://www.google.ru/maps/@55.85501,37.48524,3a,75y,15.06h,101t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sK9O2GPt4pl8YmxY9CKrtfw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1?hl=en)[deleted][deleted]Oops, right:)Finally something positive from Russia.That's a dormitory (not sure if that's the correct word) of a university.The leftmost one is the one pixel that changes P into F, I'm sure. The other one may be the one that changes O into U. It's easy to see why these two. [](/twiponder)[](/twidaw)I was hoping to see this! Thanks!Cool! I'll tag you as the artist on Derpibooru then...Just one pixel to change it into FONIES[](/rdsalute) Yup! I got inspired while staying up all night defending her. [](/notangry)I've had to fix that P and O so many bucking times now...We've had to clean up a lot more poop than this is showing. I Think the text is unnecessary.  [](/ppshrug)As much as I initially opposed the writing I have to say it did an excellent job distracting vandals. Editing one pixel on the letters provided more immediate gratification than editing one pixel on Dashie. 

Things seem to have calmed down now. Fonies
Ponies
Punies
Funies
Fonies
Ponies...it's over now and survived with only a few errorsthe text was a stroke of genius, whoever came up with it should be commended.Good point.  It draws people away from Dashie, but also attracts them.   

What to do... what to do...[](/takealetter)A few observations:

* Most of the vandalism has been focused on the writing

* Most of the vandalism in the area is focused primarily on RD+writing and Sans.

* There are some who have not seen the updated template

* Most of the vandalism on RD itself is on the mane and tail

* The attack of the Void has failed completely and utterly

If anyone wants to take a look for themselves, the IP adress is play.pickaxis.com, then after you've connected type /server place2 into the console[](/ppseesyou) not only was the writing attacked a lot, it looked like TWO SPECIFIC PIXELS were attacked the most. Man. Contention. 

-GM, master of content.Faithfully keeping the Dashie forever asleep.[](/rdsalute)[](/spikehappy)I'd just like to say, I totally called it on adding extra stuff being more likely to draw more vandals (if you've been paying attention from the first hours, anyone widening their scope tended to be "punished" by vandals). That *being* said, we seem to have the focus and dedication (or... *sigh* scripts, yes I'm in the anti-script camp), in order to defend all the additions to Sleepy Dashie.[](/pinkamina)Five! Five pixels to change PONIES into PENISS! Ah, ah, ah![](/flutterkay) I can see the poop towers.They wanted to change "ponies!" to "funiest". Vandalism AND misspelling, how dare theythe text made a great buffer for vandals against dash, everyone wanted it to be turned into penis.[](/ajwut)I figured they would be even higher!Can't say I'm surprised by the stacks on her eyes. Most of my pixels during Saturday was spent trying to fix those.[](/rdwut) The text really is super exploitable.[](/rdcool) Somehow, none of your points surprise me.

&gt;The attack of the Void has failed completely and utterly

Phew, that's a relief. I was worried for like... an hour.[Sleep on, Dashie.](http://imgur.com/a/3HrS7) [](/twiponder) I think she might be eating too much fiber. IIRC, it was started a bit after the Sleepy RD was doner/Halo here... the Green you used for the Chief here is so much better than what we had to work with. Closer to the actual colour.Well, seems like the text is doing a good job of drawing attention from the pony....you know how in measurements of mountain ranges, there's this measure called prominence, that shows the height difference between the peak and the lowest contour line around it not encircling any higher peak? I wonder what the prominence of those text pixel towers is.Oh hell yes... glad it's over now.[](/twibeam) That's awesome, did you make that?# [](/rnotangry-intensifies) **GIVE ME MY WINGS BACK!!!**

*Steals Spike's butterfly wings*Hey there!  I'm back with another story.

This one is [Antipodes](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/20/antipodes) by PK.

Someone recommended that one on TV Tropes eons ago, and I was bored, so here we are!

Overall, I liked this story.  It's a very competent adventure, with plenty of characterization, new locales, mysteries to unravel.

Here's a synopsis:

"Set in the far future after Celestia and Luna mysteriously vanished and the sun and moon froze in the sky, Antipodes is the story of two ponies thrust out into the harsh new world on an adventure to uncover what happened to the world so long ago."

Anywhow, if you're unfamilliar with who I am and what I do, as a hobby I turn Fanfictions into High Quality Text To Speech Audiobooks.  I try to make it a lot better than an unfeeling load-n-dump:  I go through and fix as much spelling and punctuation as I can; I find new words and make sure they're pronounced properly in-voice; Add pauses between sections, paragraphs, and in dialogue for maximum comprehension; emphasize italicized text; and best of all change pitch between Dialogue and Narration so you always know when someone is talking.

Anyhoo, I hope you folks out there can find something to enjoy here!

The story is very engaging and is one of the rare stories that kept me up reading well past 3am.

I'll update in a couple hours with a top 10 list or something. Just don't have time at the moment and just wanted to plug Stardust.

*Decided to just make a bookshelf on fimfiction of my favorites since it turned into a little more than a top 10: https://www.fimfiction.net/bookshelf/962635/my-favoritesIt's alright. Honestly I should start linking to the actual reviewed story shelves in my review posts.[Totally no the multi-chapter fanficiton I've been working on for years](https://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/57alyc/the_fanfic_recommendation_linkswap_thread/d8qrbws/) (2 chapters in that link, let me know if you want more!)

[](/ajlie)Each Thursday there is a fanfic swap thread that goes up. I highly recommend digging through some of the older posts as an easy way to find a long list of fanfics. Or come join the rest of us next Thursday!

There are already a lot of great recommendations in this thread so I'll limit myself to one. [The Mare Who Once Lived on the Moon](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/247031/the-mare-who-once-lived-on-the-moon). Very well written and just the right length it's about a different universe where Twilight meets her friends under very different circumstances from the show. I really don't want to say too much as I feel anything would spoil the story.It's actually on my Read Later list, I just haven't gotten around to it yet. &lt;3 But I'll bump it up in terms of priority.[](/twismile)I'd recommend heading over to /r/mylittlefanfic and checking out the sidebar. There're a lot of tools for finding great FIMFiction to read, as well as resources for writers/prospective writers like yourself.

[](/sp)

[](/twibeam)One of our resident pals, /u/titaniumdragon, is a writer, editor, and critic and he has three public libraries that I like to recommend to new readers. My *own* tastes tend to stray a fair bit from his, but they're really great starting points!

[](/sp)

[Read-it-Sooner](https://www.fimfiction.net/bookshelf/687804/read-it-sooner?order=date_added&amp;page=20) The best of the best! This bookshelf includes some of the best works on FIMFiction, from hidden gems to FIMFiction classics almost as old as the fandom.

[](/sp)

[Read-it-Later](https://www.fimfiction.net/bookshelf/592053/read-later-high-priority) Good stories, great writing, good or bad feels depending on your mood. Not the cream of the crop, but still great.

[](/sp)

[Read-it-Eventually](https://www.fimfiction.net/bookshelf/272838/read-it-later) Oddball stuff, some repetitive themes, noticed a lot of jokefics in here (a fic where the fic itself IS or is at least part of the joke, rather than just the content being humorous), still *worth reading*.

[](/sp)

[](/scootacheer) Now, these interpretations are mine, you'd have to ask TD what they mean exactly to him since they're his shelves. But even years later I still find myself heading back to look for something new to read via those bookshelves.[Here's a relevant recent thread on the topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/5ham3v/remaking_the_a_reading_guide_to_pony_fanfiction/) and [a followup](https://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/5kerm7/remaking_the_a_reading_guide_to_pony_fanfiction/). I'd throw in scifipony (author@FiMfic) in there, but that's just, like, my opinion, man.

&gt;  I've been looking to start writing fanfiction for the show

[](/icametowritefanfics "a LOT of time") Be prepared to devote a lot of time. Especially if you're trying to write longer things.

[](/sp)

Here are a number of very highly rated fics that aren't single chapters from my favorites list.

[Apotheosis](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/7335/apotheosis)

ADVENTURE

[Eternal](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/5921/eternal) by Device Heretic

&gt; Many years after sending her beloved protege to Ponyville, unease sits heavily on Princess Celestia's heart as her relationship with Twilight Sparkle seems to have cooled despite all they've accomplished together. On the advice of her sister, Celestia sets out to investigate and resolve the lost connection with her most faithful student. What does it mean to be a Faithful Student...or a Princess of the Sun?

There's something which has gone deeply amiss between Twilight Sparkle and Princess Celestia. Twilight Sparkle is trying to be perfect, while Princess Celestia is dealing with some greater issue while trying not to get too close or be too distant from Twilight Sparkle. When Princess Celestia falls into a coma, trapped inside her own mind, Twilight Sparkle, with the help of Princess Luna, must dive into her mentor's mind, working out her own issues with Celestia along the way while Celestia has to deal with her own feelings and past mistakes.

[Hard Reset](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset) by Eakin

&gt; Twilight isn't having a very good day. An experimental spell blew up in her face, an army of changelings is attacking Canterlot, and she just died. Yet somehow, it looks like it's going to keep going downhill from here.

&gt; Given the chance to correct what's gone wrong, Twilight swears she's going to fix all this even if it kills her. Which it will. Frequently.

Twilight Sparkle is trapped in a time loop which resets every time she dies. She has to try and figure out some way to protect Canterlot from a surprise changeling attack with just a few hours to plan in - and without going crazy from the various resets.

[Arrow 18 Mission Logs: Lone Ranger](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/13616/arrow-18-mission-logs-lone-ranger)

&gt; The star system Omega Centauri was just another oddity on a map to scientists in the not too distant future.  However when they found the star was orbiting an earth-sized, earth-like planet instead of a black hole as its motion had suggested, a mission was scrambled to investigate this most unusual of celestial behaviors.

&gt; Hamstrung by politics, and nearly crippled before it began, the 'Lone Ranger' mission was reduced to just one crew member and left to his own devices.

&gt; These are the logs of Arrow 18 and its lone commander.  This information is classified TOP SECRET by the Global Space Agency.  

Told in the form of log entries and transcripts, this is the story of a human being sent to a faraway system in order to study it, only to come across the world of Equestria. As a first contact story, this is about a human trying to figure out a world with magic, how it works in terms of science, as well as interacting with the locals, learning their language (and having them learn his), ect.

DRAMA

[Tiny Wings](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/23865/tiny-wings)

&gt; Scootaloo has always been a filly with big dreams, but can they all come true?

&gt; At the very least, she can always follow in the hoofsteps of her hero, right?

A story about Scootaloo and Rainbow Dash dealing with Scootaloo's inability to fly.

[Mortal](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/95424/mortal)

&gt; Twilight Sparkle's friends have lived long and happy lives. Now their time is coming to an end, but Rainbow Dash, at least, will not go gently. Twilight has the power to save her friend's life. Is it worth violating the natural order?

This is a story about Twilight having to decide whether or not turning everyone in Equestria into immortal alicorns is a moral choice, as it will change the world forever if she does so.

Anyway... I do story reviews, so if you're interested, give me a poke either here or [over on FIMFiction](https://www.fimfiction.net/user/Titanium%20Dragon) and I can point you in the right direction if there's anything in particular you're looking for.I looked through your bookshelves and to my shock and horror, you don't have [Mother of Invention](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/71501/mother-of-invention) on any of your lists! Sure, it's not a slice of life/comedy/romance, which seems to be your favorites, but the writing is top notch and probably does the best job of any fanfic I've read of projecting a feeling of helplessness, loneliness, dread, and hope upon the reader.

We tend to enjoy a lot of the same stories, and this one sits firmly at #2 behind Stardust (which you should also read).I second Hard Reset.

Also, though it's semi-permanently unfinished, Harder Reset, by Horizon.* Anything by [Pen Stroke](https://www.fimfiction.net/user/Pen+Stroke). He's one of the more accessible writers and has a great "show-like" style where even his horror stories have a strong pony-feel. I personally recommend [*Past Sins*](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/41596/past-sins), [*Winter Bells*](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/71883/winter-bells), and [*Into the Depths*](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/60514/into-the-depths).

* [*Collaborators*](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/228000/collaborators) by [Baal Bunny](https://www.fimfiction.net/user/Baal+Bunny) - a must-read for the character development and natural banter of two nominal enemies.

* [*My Little Metro*](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/446/my-little-metro) by [redsquirrel456](https://www.fimfiction.net/user/redsquirrel456) `[Incomplete]` - My favorite example of post-apocalyptic ponies done *right* in a genre oversaturated with *Fallout:Equestria* imitators. Very long, incomplete, and on hiatus, but one of my favorite fics ever.

* [*Friendly AC-130 Inbound*](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/316415/friendly-ac-130-inbound) by [Azriel](https://www.fimfiction.net/user/Azriel) `[Incomplete]` - May fly a little under-the-radar (seewatididthar) by virtue of being a Humans in Equestria (HiE) story. It's worth a read for a less-cringey, more realistic exploration of military tropes in a pony setting.

If you're looking for novella length and above (20k+ words), I'd recommend the following:

EPISODE-LIKE

[The Numbers Don't Lie](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/88575/the-numbers-dont-lie) by shortskirtsandexplosions

&gt; When the Cutie Mark Crusaders dig up an ancient magical artifact, they unleash a spell on the town that allows everypony to see a "lie meter" floating above each other's heads. While attempting to solve the mystery, Twilight Sparkle has to analyze the tenuous balance between friendship and honesty. She doesn't like what she finds.

This is a sort of episode-feeling story about Twilight learning about the lies friends tell each other, and what honesty between friends really is all about. It sounds kind of hokey, but it is actually a very good story with some interesting insights into honesty and truth-telling, as well as white lies.

COMEDY

[Whom the Princesses Would Destroy](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/54117/whom-the-princesses-would-destroy) by Ghost of Heraclitus

&gt; To Twilight Sparkle and Princess Celestia, it is a simple surprise visit to Canterlot. To the ponies of the Equestrian Civil Service, it is twenty-four hours of chaos, politics, weaponized dessert, politics, underhooved manipulation of media, politics, and things batrachian and tentacular. Who said bureaucracy isn't exciting?

This is a footnotes comedy story about the ponies of the Equestrian Civil Service, a bunch of beleaguered public servants, having to deal with the various behind the scenes press shenanigans and preparations for dealing with Twilight Sparkle showing up for an unexpected visit in Canterlot. This primarily focuses on a cast of OCs, but is a very funny story.

ROMANCE

[Twisting Between the Sheets](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/87607/twisting-between-the-sheets) by HoofBitingActionOverload

&gt; When Rarity’s friends discover that she has been secretly meeting with an escort, they begin investigating, and soon discover a web of lies and unrequited romances none of them ever could have expected.

This is a great shipfic about Rarity having an unrequited crush on Applejack, while Rarity herself has an unrequited crush on her from the escort she's been hiring (who is an OC). This is a T-rated story about Rarity and her struggle to deal with her feelings towards her friend, and her making a number of mistakes along the way.

[The Games We Play](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/3479/the-games-we-play)

&gt; There's been another sighting of the mysterious Mare Do Well...but this time, all of Rainbow Dash's friends plead ignorance, insisting that they've put aside their costumes for good. Rainbow Dash is determined to uncover the masked mare's true identity before she's humiliated yet again, but this time around, the vigilante seems especially interested in her as well. Will Rainbow Dash be able to solve the mystery before the culprit takes the hoax too far? Or is she in danger of losing not only her mind, but her heart?

This is a kind of strange story, but it is quite good. One of Rainbow Dash's friends has been dressing up as the Mysterious Mare Do Well again in order to act out a bit - in part, act out on emotions and feelings they have for Rainbow Dash, but in secret. This drives Rainbow Dash absolutely up the wall as she tries to figure out which of her friends is doing this to her, doubly so as the Mysterious Mare Do Well is kind of bitter about the fact that, outside of her disguise, Rainbow Dash doesn't seem interested in her at all. It is about Rainbow Dash having to deal with some of her personal issues, as well as her feelings.

[Twilight's List](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/21583/twilights-list) by Kits

&gt; Twilight Sparkle prides herself on following and sticking to her plans, but she isn't as organized as everypony thinks. Her master list, the plan for her life, has an item that she has never been able to check off; and the time has come to fix that. How hard can it be? All she needs to do is go on a date and get a kiss.

This is a funny TwiDash shipfic about Twilight asking Rainbow Dash out on an experimental date, basically as a sort of playacting, so that Twilight can get some experience with this sort of thing.

The only problem is that Rainbow Dash totally zoned out during Twilight's explanation of what was going on, and thinks that Twilight is asking her out for reals.

Hilarity (and also a bit of angst) ensues as Rainbow Dash tries to figure out her feelings for Twilight, and Twilight gets swept up in it all.

[Best Young Flyer](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/34029/best-young-flyer) by bookplayer

&gt; Scootaloo has a job as a flight instructor in Cloudsdale and a cloud house of her own. She doesn't have a special somepony, but she's cool with that. Just a normal life for a normal young pegasus, until a streak of rainbow turns her life upside-down.

&gt; After all, could she really resist the chance to train for the Best Young Flyers competition with a Wonderbolt? Could she turn down an offer of no-strings-attached passion with the most awesome pegasus in Equestria? Is there any way she could not fall in love with the shining idol of her foalhood?

&gt; Could Scootaloo ever say no to Rainbow Dash?

This is a story set about ten years in the future. Rainbow Dash is a Wonderbolt, and Scootaloo has gotten her first real job as a flight school instructor for students who struggle to fly, just as she did. Rainbow Dash and Scootaloo strike up a friends with benefits type relationship, which quickly ends up becoming much more serious for Rainbow Dash, while Scootaloo has to constantly remind herself that Rainbow Dash isn't really interested in her. Despite being tagged as a comedy, this story is pretty heavy on heartbreak, as Rainbow Dash has to struggle with her feelings for Scootaloo while Scootaloo herself has to deal with her idol worship of Rainbow Dash.[](/nmm)[Imgur mirror](http://imgur.com/DkioxkM)

[](/sp)
Great job!There was bound to be vandalism in the final product, but at least it was only three pixels.I stuck online about an hour, trying to kill the turd and one of the eye glitches. But in the end, I had to get some sleep. 

Sweet Dashie, I have failed you.It doesn't show the last few hours. I know because I was defending the nope.avi art, and it was pixel perfect by the time the thing was over. Yeah SU almost got consumed by the Norwegians and we had to move the N7 logo because of the damn Runescape reference. I'm glad void didn't take this or N7. Fantastic work![](/flutterwoah) 12m16s for [mine](http://www.websudoku.com/?level=4&amp;set_id=6397663606), but maybe that was an 'easier' one.

14m39s for /u/Woldsom's [puzzle](http://www.websudoku.com/?challenge=ggzwauqc).For something that anyone with an account could have disrupted or worse, the fact that this and other things came out beautifully made this a fun thing to be a part of and remember. There were attemps, but no one was able to break our defenses![](/rdsalute) Ladies and Gentlemen, it was a pleasure serving with you.

[](/sp)
[](/rawwyeah) PONIES! PONIES! PONIES!yay i helped with the berrytube/berrypunch cutiemark
Despite the stray pixels, she is beautiful. Friendship really is magic, everybody/pony! Thank. RD had been around since the beginning, it was a cultural landmark. It would be like vandalizing Bender.[](/rdwut)PUNIES! FONIES! PONIES![](/twipride) She looks quite...Dashing!I just watched the time lapse and I was really impressed. Dashie shows up rather early in the process, establishes a black border and then is pretty stable from then on. And she actually takes up a fairly large space on the Place. Well done, people!  Why would they sue? If anything this is free advertising for them.[](/octavia) it was a pleasure with all of you [](/rdsalute) Outside of a few stray pixels, it turned out quite well. Well done bronies! It was good serving with you... even if I spent the last few hours defending Hungary.

[](/sp)

[](/flutterwink) No other April's project had interested me before, but I've got surprisingly invested in this one.

But I guess, things can get back to normal now. This was a lot of fun.Yeah, good thing they had it stopped *now*, and not then.

The last bursts of pixels are a bit disappointing, but at least the rest of the pic's there. I'd take that as a success, either way.[](/scootablue) It felt great coming together as a community these past few days. 

I'm a bit sad that it's over now. This project was a ton of fun! I really hope we get a chance to get this on a poster or something. Dashie is relatively prominent![](/twismile) It was fun while it lasted but I'm also glad it's over. [Here's a timelapse of the whole thing from beginning to end.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3zCWcAgfbg) Pretty cool.Sorry I wasn't around in the end. Glad to see she survived from start to finish though![](/dashheart) Awesome job! I'm happy to have made a few corrections here and there. A few stray pixels were to be expected in the end. Credit to everyone who worked on her![](/rdhappy) "Good luck?" Ha! As if I'll need that!

[](/sp) *Ten minutes later...*

[](/rrdcool) Crap, this is actually a hard one.I think you mean the "P. Onies"All considered, it is awesome just how complete Dashie stayed. Good work everyone.What Reddit (as a collective) has done on r/place is art. It may look generic if you focus on very specific things (all full of flags and memes) but the message that it provides along with all the effort put into it, makes it a very unique symbol of the internet, at least, in my personal opinion. This should be renembered. I can't look at this without feeling a lot of fellowship, strength, and many other things.

And it has A PONY ON IT! Now we're a legend. And, as we know...

The legend NEVER DIES.http://i.imgur.com/90zHiw4.gifv

Final image of the entire board is [here](https://i.imgur.com/QHEEOKB.png).FONIES! FONIES! FONIES![Sepukku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seppuku)[](/rdsalute)It's not perfect, but it's pretty close! Damn those 4 pixels![](/rdsalute)SO CLOSE TO BEING PERFECT! Absolutely fantastic job keeping Dashie intact for the most part though, everyone.[](/cadancesmile)
I'm very surprised we managed to keep Dashie up for, what, like 60 something hours?

Great job though, that was really fun "April Fools joke"!
[](/twiright) The black border really helped her stand out![](/rdsalute) Good job, guys! This was a lot of fun. I have nothing against you guys and I'm glad your place made it safely on the board, but I have to admit that I would occasionally change Ponies to Fonies. The one pixel change was easy and the urge coupled with boredom was sometimes to much. [](/ppcute) You're not the only one. Just take a look at the pictures [found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/636jy6/the_rplace_sleepy_rd_vandalism_and_corrections/) (specifically the 3rd and 4th) and you see how much that pixel was changed compared to the rest[](/twistare) Man, I should have been helping today. I thought 'the activity has died down, we'll be fine, I can work on my school.' But those PIXELS.... [](/sp)

[](/ppshrug) oh well, good job anyway everyone! We were one of the most contested places on the map! PONIES TRIUMPH!

-GM, master of map.I think it helped that most of the 'attacks' were going after the "PONIES" instead of RD herself.I saw others trying to change the letters but keep the P, N, and I to read "penis".  They got half way there for a moment.[](/dashheart) I'm sad I missed the creation of Dash, but I did what I could to protect her.  It was a lot of fun.[](/soawesome) This was a lot of fun.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to /r/SaveDashie. It pains me to no end that those bad pixels will stain her image forever, but the fact that we defended her so valiantly gives me hope.

I'm happy we all got to come together as a community and partake in something big for the Reddit history books together. Since we're near the end of the hiatus, let's hope we see the same kind of spirit for Season 7 and beyond.

Also, I got a [sweet new phone wallpaper](http://i.imgur.com/AC2mycl.jpg) now.[](/ppcute) I suppose you're also one of the folks that kept changing "furry" to "furby".Damn it, now I kinda wish I did, but I left them alone. At least that seems relative. Five by my count: should be an extra black dot for the left side eye, and counting the extra dot by the letters.

Still pretty stellar performance for the amount of vandalism!My brother was the one who made it say "penis" a little before this. I'm sorry.Oh well don't worry about it. We had it ( mostly ) properly by the time place ended :)Man I took this serious like my job and celebrated the success of it like that one time I did something actually impactful :3Nah, I solved [the first one I got](http://www.websudoku.com/?challenge=ggzwauqc) with logic just now, though it took me 41:56 - it *was* rather evil, but no guessing was necessary.The "penies" buglight was pretty helpful too.  Looking at the [heatmap](http://i.imgur.com/a95XXDz.gifv) you can see a TON of vandalism efforts were drawn to the words.

...and them brown pixels to the right

[](/rdannoyed "seriously?")Surprised it dosnt get completely vandalised tbhYAY! We did it!His middle name is ReallycooldudeThis is why I advocated so hard for keeping the words during the great assault, it's a lot easier to fix words with obvious errors than it is to fix a not-so-obvious ear extension (which happened on multiple occasions).

Also, the brown pixels are actually explained by what we were being assaulted with. Thanks to /r/Croatia and their [flawed timelapse of Professor Baltazar](https://gfycat.com/WiltedFrailBoaconstrictor) we can see that the brown is a result of the image that some group was attempting to take us over with, not any kind of representation of pony poop.

[](/flutterstare)[](/twiponder) We worked together to defend something great [](/sp) [](/rtwiponder) Working together requires cooperation [](/sp) [](/twiponder) Cooperation requires tolerance [](/sp) [](/rtwiponder) tolerance implies a friendly relationship [](/sp) [](/twiponder) Friendly relationships are essentially friendships [](/sp) [](/rtwiponder) What we made is pretty magical [](/sp) [](/twiright) So us doing this proves friendship is magic. We do it folksI helped on Haskell as well!
I actually dedicated one night into building it, but then I returned back to Dashie!

It's sad thought that it looks kinda worse now, [than it was right after we've initially bulit it](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/290956641388462081/298041650079596554/l.png)

If you're talking about the current state of cutie mark, it's not vandals, we just changed the template to that at some point yesterday, because most people have agreed with this change.[](/addespair) I wasn't there to help her when she needed me cause I had to be a responsible adult.hurrayy

cuz i hated the stripesyay! good job everyone!I'm afraid I'd have to look up the proof, but yes; I think they're designed to always be solvable.  So long as you have enough numbers in a certain assortment, it will let you deduce the rest.

As to a resource, [this one](http://www.sudokudragon.com/sudokustrategy.htm) does a pretty good job of explaining, and it has an 'advanced' page as well.  The biggest thing is that for the hard puzzles, at some point you need deduction.

After you've done all the numbers you consider easy, list all the numbers possible for each remaining cell.  Sometimes you'll find a cell that can only take one number, so you fill that in right away - and as you fill, remove those from the possibilities associated.  Then, you look for singles and patterns; single numbers remaining in rows, columns, or blocks, and more importantly patterns that will let you eliminate other options.  The most important of these tends to be naked twins - two cells in the same row, column, or block that have the same two options (or three with the same three options), which allows you say "these two have either X or Y, which means X and Y can't featured in the rest of this row/colum/block" - so you scratch those possilbities off, and in doing so reveal what remains - if what's left is singles, you fill those and trim down every possibility affected, and if not sometimes you reveal further naked twins or the like.  Remember, a naked twin can be in both a block and a row/colum, but need not be, and only applies to what it's in unless there's another (or chain thereof) that they're paired with.

Occasionally you'll find a use for the more advanced patterns the page goes into, which revolve around finding linked pairs and nixing the other potentials or finding discrepancies, but they're extrapolations on the basic exclusion principle.

With a bit of practice, even the hardest puzzles will generally take under twenty minutes.[deleted][Sudoku.](http://imgur.com/a/In7WD)[](/rdsalute) It was a long journey. We struggled quite a bit keeping Dashie safe and error free. Sadly some last second bad pixels got in. But boy was this fun.

Thanks to everyone who helped out!Good lord! Thank goodness it ended when it did! Had it been any other time, the writing on the top might just be locked as PENISS.

Great job, people.[deleted]We had it pretty under control at the end -- in fact, she was 100% pixel perfect most of the time for the last few hours. Makes me feel a little sad that the last few seconds got a burst of bad pixels.[](/raritywhy)NOOOO! THOSE STRAY PIXELS WILL HAUNT ME UNTIL THE END OF MY LIFE!Right at the end...I failed her.When you look at the whole place tapestry, those pixels aren't noticeable.  Dash sure stands out though as one of the larger more recognizable symbols.[](/sbstare)

Seeing how bright she was on the heatmaps really surprised me. Great job![](/ajwut) Welp, the internet has achieved a small victory today.  I legitimately couldn't remember if Samurai ritual suicide was sudoku or sepukku.actually some vandals made her bolt lightning shaped &lt;3 i am very thankful for this because the stripes SUCKEDunlikely too many company brands on here that super anal about there logo being on anything 

reddit might get sued XDWow, that's awesome! Hooray for functional ponies!

You know, I actually used the fixRD script on the Haskell area while I was sleeping. I mean, sure, I was using a messy Python script to prevent the word "Haskell" from being changed into "Python", which looks silly, but messy Python scripts are great for some things. That script's functionality was rockin'! Could hardly ask for a better one.[](/rdsalute) Glad you found the script useful!
[](/sp)The code was really messy because I actually tried to manage to glue together the code from diffierent people, and I just went "/r/place is not going to last long anyway, so it's better to just create messy code now that works, than designing something better and finish working on it at the time /r/place ends"Oh, they don't - but at that point you do have to start eliminating options going by what other potentials are visible.  I can explain the method in more detail, if you like?Most time lapses you see are pulled directly from the API, and are thus correct at the time they are requested. The time lapse I linked is likely done by pointing video recording at the spot and letting it run for a while, which has proven to be variable at best.[](/twisecret) *Still better artwork than Fosgitt.*Wanted to thank you guys on your own thread for helping with the r/halo piece. Good neighbors, great neighbors. Love how rainbow dash turned out!Because they're super Anal about their logo being on anything they don't own let alone on something with a another company's logo I think the words also invited further vandals that would have gone somewhere else otherwise. It took so little to change them that they could see their progress. Without the words they would have had to vandalize RD only and if it kept getting fixed a lot of them would get bored and move on.I feel a little less bad now. Not a fan of puzzles that *require* you to guess either.[](/awwyeah) Good job everypony! I'm proud of us being able to do this, and keeping her sleeping for about 60 hours!No hard feelings.[](/sp)
[](/squintyjack)[](/sp)

Seriously though, great work on the script.[](/derpycheer)Long live the P.ONIES!(!!)[](/scootablue)RD will be forever immortalized with a turd and a blood tear... the two specific things I tried so very hard to always correct.

[](/sp)

[](/twistare)I've brought dishonor to the Dashie. I must [commit sudoku](http://www.websudoku.com/?level=4).It also made it harder for others to encroach on her area. Any spare space was being filled up by small sprites, and a lot of pieces got buried in the process. [deleted]maybe she was just having diarrhea April Fools social experiment. 

[](/wahaha)The new term for "prank". [](/DIDNEYWORL) But now we're only 12 days away from the end of the haitus! So if anything this just killed some time.[](/rdwut) Paul Onies. One of the guys who created My Little Pony, along with Mark Y. and Laurence Ittle.Good job everyone! We saved the Dashie![](/scootacheer) Great job, everyone! A few stray pixels, but overall that's still Rainbow Dash, alive and well. Before the OSU logo popped up and drew away a lot of the hate there were times when she looked a *lot* worse than this. I'm glad none of those were immortalized.OMG YES I COMPLETELY FORGOT !!!! YAY !!!!Don't forget about Frederick IendshipismagicI spent so much time and effort protecting Dashie that I can't even describe how much of a relief it is to be done. It was an amazing experience though, and really brought me closer to this sub and the awesome people on it! Glad to be a part of r/MyLittlePony history and Reddit history in general!Thank Celestia, I don't know if I could've handled a week/month of r/place  
  
It got kind of stressful at times.  
  
The ending vandalism is kind of lame, but we did a good job keeping her graffiti-free for almost the entire run, and really, the vandalism isn't even noticeable when looking at the full canvas spread.  
  
Good job, everypony who helped out! And many thanks and kudos to our neighbors and friends (like BerryTube) as well.Someone did say they were going to take the final canvas, and fix stray blocks in the art. So hopefully they go through with it!Link that background image yo!

I need a pixel perfect dash on my lock screen[](/c21) Screw it, I'm just going to use ~~a python script~~ magic to solve it.People were trying to have her grow a dick at one point.[](/rdsalute)[nope.avi](http://gfycat.com/MellowConsciousAsianwaterbuffalo)

First thing that came to mind...I like the way it was explained by saddlesoapOpera in the pony psychology series, since magic is eternal, and she's the embodiment of her element of Harmony, she cannot die.

Still one of my favorite pieces of fan fiction I've ever read, only second to Fallout Equestria.[](/celestia)

Your friends are in the same place they've been the last 200 years.

[](/sp)

[](/celestiamad)

And they'll stay right where they are. Don't think I haven't noticed your little experiments in necromancy.Please remember to include text when using out-of-sub emotes so that people without BPM don't see a blank post.Ah, my apologies.[](/twiponder)Personally I prefer the headcanon that Twilight chooses mortality in order to live out her life with friends and family, rather than the seemingly more common one that Twilight, Cadance, and now Flurry Heart are arbitrarily completely different from Celestia and Luna and are for some random reason not "true" Alicorns and thus not immortal.

I guess in general I just prefer the idea that an Alicorn is an Alicorn and there's no weird distinction, and thus there would be an interesting story reason for Twilight not outliving her friends.

[](/sp)

[](/twistare)You could also interpret it that Twilight will have some horrible freak accident in her lab one day and be blown to Kingdom come.

Then she definitely wouldn't outlive her friends.&gt; Personally I prefer the headcanon that Twilight chooses mortality in order to live out her life with friends and family

[](/twisad) I don't like to think of Twilight becoming suicidal at the loss/impending loss of her friends.[](/rtwiright)Also good.

I actually futzed around with writing a fimfic that was kind of in between where the bearers lived out their natural lives, but through the Elements Twilight could call on them at any time for guidance, or even in times of great need summon them from Elysium, D&amp;D style. Sadly I just don't have the writing chops, but I'm still fond of the idea.[](/twicrazy)

Who would visit?I'm pretty sure Carrot Top and Applejack have some bad blood between them. [](/ajugh) Prop comedy is laziest form of humor and that HACK knows it!I wouldn't call the Flim Flam brothers rivals of Applejack. Rivalry imply  that they are competing over something. Flim and Flam are basic con artists who Applejack is trying to protect her family and others against. Her interaction with them isn't because she sees them as valid competitors.They're competing with Applejack's core value of integrity - when they appear, they are challenging her integrity, and so they are rivals for the value of what she stands for, her moral values. Applejack makes a high-integrity, excellent quality cider even though the Flam Flams value of productivity challenges her ability to keep her farm - she would rather lose her farm and keep her integrity, than sacrifice her integrity to winning a competition. And she would rather be honest about what happened with Granny Smith than compromise her integrity for the sake of saving her face. They aren't competitors in the sense that something about their "personality" or whatever is competing with Applejack in terms of say, some sort of popularity contest - but they're still competing with her, as representations of a way of living, of being true and fair.While we haven't seen any re-occurring rivals in the show, apart from the Flim Flam brothers, I'm pretty sure most of the mane 6 have one antagonist.

Rarity has [Suri Polomare](http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Suri_Polomare).

Rainbow Dash has [Lightning Dust](http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Lightning_Dust) and [Wind Rider](http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Wind_Rider).

Applejack has the [Flim Flam Brothers](http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Flim_and_Flam).

Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie have no real rivals. Their enemies are more or less concepts and not people, in the sense that Fluttershy's... well, shyness and timidness are her "enemies", and Pinkie's missing concept of personal space is hers.

[](/flutterfear)[](/ppboring)To truly have any sort of rivalry there are certain conditions that need to be meant.

1. More than 1 must be seeking the same exact goal.
2. The amount that can achieve said goal is less than those after said goal.
and 3. They have to seriously know about each other.

This, however, doesn't mean they have to even be attempting to achieve it in the slightest same way.

This means that only Rarity and Rainbow Dash have rivals.  Most of which weren't even hinted at in the series.

Closest thing to a rival that Twilight Sparkle has is Sunset Shimmer since she was going for the same position that Twilight Sparkle goes after.  But since Celestia removes Sunset Shimmer from our tutorage as punishment for her over inflated ego before Celestia took Twilight Sparkle as a personal protégé, Sunset Shimmer and Twilight Sparkle didn't having the slightest chance of being rivals.

Fluttershy's lack of any sort of rivalry comes simply from the fact that she prefers doing and getting stuff most others aren't interested in.

Applejack really can't count on anybody but her siblings and Rainbow Dash to be rivals since Sweet Apple Acres is far too important for Ponyville to be able to work.  With her siblings, it has to do more with whom is going to take over Sweet Apple Acres when Granny Smith is gone.  And with Rainbow Dash, it is simply a case of the only 1 whom she competes against whom is straight up interested in winning rather than just to enjoy the contest.

Finally, Pinkamenia Diane Pie lacks rivals as she rather work with others rather than compete against them when it comes to common goals.  And there is the fact that any competition to Sugar Cube Corner would be more a rivalry between the Cakes and the other shops rather than with Pinkamenia as the Cakes are the ones that own Sugar Cube Corner.But Applejack *is* in every episode that the Flim Flam Brothers also appear in. Like they're connected.Applejack has a rivalry with the Flim Flams

You've got a good point thoughPinkie thought Cheese was a rival, turns out he was not but that is as close we can get. That sounds fair. 

She's obviously an orcapony, but I can totally see being overly cautious.[](/spikenervous) I've got... bad... news...

Thanks again.
 If you wanna see something more mature with a sense of peril. Try some of the two parter premieres/finales

There's even a battle in season 4 episode 26 that parodies Dragon Ball Z. The premiere and finale of season 5 are also very dark.

As for your questions, "earth pony" is basically the name of any pony that is not a unicorn or pegasus. It doesn't have any connection to Earth the planet, it's more of a reference to the dirt/ground as they're known to have exceptional farming skills.

The purple one (Twilight Sparkle) is gifted in magic yes, and is attending a school for gifted unicorns in the beginning of the series.&gt; im a 19 year old male metalhead (anything from Dio to Carach Angren) so not a likely candidate for MLP :P

You'd be surprised at how many fans are *very* much like you.

&gt; they talk about having magic and doing things the "earth pony way" is their world above part of or separate to ours?

[](/ajhappy) "The earth pony way" refers to doing things without the use of unicorn magic--that glowy stuff when Twilight Sparkle (the purple one) or anyone else with a horn teleports or moves stuff around, etc.  Ponies without wings or horns are called "earth ponies" because they are land borne and their magic lies in their physical strength, dexterity, and connection to nature.  The "earth" part of it refers to "earth" as in the ground, not "Earth" the planet.

&gt; has the purple one got super strong magic or something?

[](/twisecret-m) Indeed she does.  Watch from the beginning to find out why.
[](/sp)
&gt; however its major drawbacks are being very childish and simplistic (as expected), also no major conflict the problems that arose were tiny!( again its what you expect)

[](/scootaplease) Since you watched a season 1 episode, a rather childish air and simple conflicts are indeed what you will encounter, and it is very much the same for the rest of season 1 and most of season 2 and even 3.  Still worth watching for bunches of that wholesomeness.  The end of season 3 and seasons 4 through 6 are, at least in my opinion, a whole new ballpark in terms of complexity of content and quality of animation.

[](/ooh) I *highly* recommend that if you continue your ~~dark descent~~ journey into this show that you watch from the beginning to really appreciate the growth of the overall show and the characters.  If not, no big deal.  Ain't no one forcing you to do anything.
[](/sp)

[](/spikeapproves) Thanks for giving the show a shot at least.  You're a swell dude.&gt; as someone who has a pet rabbit THEY AINT THAT NICE

Oooooh, you clearly haven't met Angel Bunny yet, then.

&gt; who is the huge red one is that a horse?!

[](/eeyup) This fellow? Big Macintosh. Applejack's big brother.

He doesn't talk much.

[](/sp)

&gt; also no major conflict the problems that arose were tiny!( again its what you expect)

Every now and then, the ponies have to prevent some variety of apocalypse. Starting in the opening two-parter.

&gt; overall i now understand why some people like it but its not my cup of tea ...maybe someday when i just want something innocent and cutesy i will watch another episode

[Sure](http://iambrony.steeph.tp-radio.de/mlp/gif/fluttershybear3.gif)

(Yes, that actually happened in the show... an early Season Two episode)

&gt; has the purple one got super strong magic or something?

The purple one is a particularly powerful mage, yes. (See Boast Busters for a brief in-episode discussion).[](/scootacheer) Welp, that's basically what my opinion was when I first tried to sit down and watch some episodes. I was like 'eh, not bad, but eh, not for me.' ...That didn't last long. I was eventually dragged in by my feet kicking and screaming. [](/sp)

[](/flutternice) It may not be your cup of tea, and that's fine, it is a bit hard to get into. But I'll ask you not to dismiss it because of an initial impression. (also the fandom has awesome projects that are cool even if you like the show or not. I started in the fandom, and slowly worked my way down to the episodes.) [](/sp) 

[](/ppshrug) regardless, glad you gave it a shot! Now you understand us... somewhat. [](/sp)

-GM, master of *sigh* yet another Ponk is annoying... 

i will watch another episode but so far i dont have a favorite pony...but i have a favorite dragon! SPIKE!Barring spoilers as it is the finale of the fourth season, I think you'd enjoy [Twilight's Kingdom: Part 1 &amp; Part 2](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1ugpvz_4x25-my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-twilight-s-kingdom-part-1_shortfilms) even if not the show at large.Don't watch further if you don't want to watch all of it. I started watching it before season 1 had ended and I felt the same as you do, but I kept watching without knowing why. Years later it's 6 seasons deep and I'm still hopelessly addicted. If you continue, your feelings about the show will start to change for the better, but only after another season or more of "Why the hell can't I stop watching this, I don't even like it, what the hell is wrong with me?"

My personal theory is that the show is providing something you need but can't quite quantify. The mystery of that elusive nectar is what keeps you going. You keep watching because you want to know why you keep watching. Is there an end to that cycle? Who knows? You may just end up like me, meaning you will eventually stop caring and just enjoy the show unconditionally because it makes you smile so much you feel like an idiot.[](/twisecret) Friendship Is Magic parts 1 &amp; 2 is the least impactful/most childish of the two-parters. I think the best ones are Twilight's Kingdom, Cutie Map, Cutie Re-Mark and To Where and Back Again. 

Edit: Canterlot Wedding is great toAny particular reason you started with episode 11 instead of at the beginning? The first two episodes do a great job introducing all the characters, and the conflict is much heavier.for me that show is called "fairy tale" :P i dont know why i watch it i just do
[](/cheekystarlight) You are quite tenacious, aren't you? [](/sp)

-GM, master of flicks. Yea, season 1 had very light conflicts. The show was still rated TV-Y, so there were some tight constraints. Season 2 relaxed the rating a bit, and things got more interesting.

As for your questions: the place is called Equestria (yay horse puns) and no, it's not on our Earth, it's a fantasy world. There are three main types of ponies. First the more common Earth pony, which has no overt magic, but are very strong and good with the land. Pegasi (pegasuses? pegapodes? whatever) can fly and control the weather. Unicorns have spell-type magic, of which Twilight is especially gifted. There can be individual variations, such as Fluttershy's ability with animals, but that's the general rule.

Well, whether you enjoyed it or not, thank you giving it a try. No, it's not everyone cup of tea, but a fair shot is appreciated.

If you still want to hang about, it'd be great to have you. /r/MLPLounge has a bunch of great people that hang around, many of whom don't watch the show but stick around none the less.[](/fluttershh-r) Just a tiny little 180º neck massage.&gt;theme song thoughts: sounds alright but it wont get a spot on my ipod

Wouldn't be on mine either. I've always hated the theme.[](/ssohyou)Oh look, it's that one guy from the Plounge who signs all his posts.

-Zora, who never signs posts.[](/sarcasticss)Nope. I know you from Plounge, thus you are from Plounge.

I even have [proof](http://i.imgur.com/fXwMmyB.png).[](/flutternice) well, if that's the case, [you really are the true color of bacon](http://imgur.com/Pr0WyW1). 

-GM, master of yes, I had that tag for you before this conversation. &gt; I had that tag for you before this conversation.

(Yes. That did need to be four separate links.)[](/ssohyou) Did it? Did it really?

-GM, master of tagging himself. &gt; theme song thoughts: sounds alright but it wont get a spot on my ipod

A surprisingly forgiving verdict. I skipped the theme song entirely for the longest time. 

&gt; however its major drawbacks are being very childish and simplistic (as expected), also no major conflict the problems that arose were tiny!( again its what you expect)

I honestly think bronies only end up recommending Winter Wrap Up because the song was the show's first big musical number and was really catchy. My mom and I started recently showing MLP to my visiting aunt and we both agreed that Winter Wrap Up was "cute" but pretty skip-able. 

The first episodes I showed my aunt were later season episodes like:

Stranger Than Fanfiction (Though this episode makes more sense after seeing Daring Don't)

Saddle Row Review - Funniest on this list, IMO

Rarity Investigates - Crime mystery parody

Maud Pie - Another funny one, also the most slice of life of these four

But really, I think even other season 1 episodes like Sonic Rainboom or Dragonshy would've been a better choice than Winter Wrap Up. You mean fairy tail? I still read it to see how the story will end, but it got far too ecchi for my liking and the fights themselves became less appealing as time progressed. If you like that, you'd be blown away by HxH most likely.No love for S2 finale? [](/ssindeed)From 16 days in the future, I can definitely tell you that yes, it did.because thats the episode the person i made a deal with chose :)You might like this, then...

Each is a season opener or finale.  Seasons 1 and 3 had no 2-part finale.Glad you gave it a chance.  I'm always glad to hear a polite opinion about the show even if it isn't a glowing recommendation.



[](/raritysquee)But before you go you absolutely *must* tell us your favorite pony!

The music is a big draw for a lot of people.   They play with just about every genre, huge Disney Arias, Gaga-esque pop songs, Danny Elfman Ska, Weird Al polkas, Broadway ragtime, and the movies bring in electric guitar.  
[](/colgate) If you do want to get into the show, then I think the best way would be the way I search for new bands. Watch a couple random episodes, from random seasons and depending on how much you enjoy it, watch some more. Then watch it from beginning to end, if you feel like you're missing out. That's a tried and true method for me.

If you don't want to get into it, well that's fine too.

______________________________________

Some other thoughts.

&gt;they talk about having magic and doing things the "earth pony way"

The earth pony way, is to not use magic.

&gt;is their world above part of or separate to ours?

Separate. It's not Earth, it's Equestria.

&gt;has the purple one got super strong magic or something?

Yes.

&gt;as someone who has a pet rabbit THEY AINT THAT NICE,

Angel? He slaps Fluttershy in another episode. He's not nice at all.

&gt;OK so the song is growing on me "winter wrap up" its still not fantastic but it is kinda wholesome.

That's a pretty good description of most mlp songs. I'm saying that as someone who doesn't generally like the songs.

&gt;however its major drawbacks are being very childish and simplistic

Yeah, that changes after a while. Kinda. Some more serious subjects come up, some epic fights occur, but the whole thing remains lighthearted and childlike.

ill give at least two more episodes a try i normally give a show three episodes if i dont like it by then i give up&gt;&gt;&gt;as someone who has a pet rabbit THEY AINT THAT NICE, if you put your pony head near my rabbit it would bite!

[](/angel) Fluttershy's pet rabbit doesn't bite, but he slaps her if the food isn't right. He's a nice 'angel' indeed

&gt;&gt;&gt; some questions i have they talk about having magic and doing things the "earth pony way" is their world above part of or separate to ours?

I don't get your question? The "earth pony way" means doing it like the earth ponies (normal wingless hornless horses), and the cartoon takes place in a separate world from ours.

&gt;&gt;&gt;has the purple one got super strong magic or something?

Not yet at this point in the show. ;)i will give some of the two parters a try as some people have suggestedyeah thats it! its been a while went off it a little when they brought in that hades guy(and when i started watching noragami). but i kinda miss it so im gonna get back into watching it probablyOh, I do love it. I just liked season 5's 2-parters more and thought the S6 finale was more well-paced and exciting throughout. Canterlot Wedding is 3rd or 4th on my list. 

But yeah, should've mentioned that too.&gt; as someone who has a pet rabbit THEY AINT THAT NICE, if you put your pony head near my rabbit it would bite! 

Re-watched the song today and I just wanna say, that rabbit was cuddling Fluttershy. Fluttershy has a magic-based connection with animals other ponies don't have and makes nice with everything from bears to spiders. Also, as you saw in this episode the wild animals in this show are weirdly domesticated tot he point they need ponies to wake them from hibernation. 

But like other said, the main rabbit in this show smacks Fluttershy in the face if she gets his food wrong. what are some of the two parters called?&gt;(Yes, that actually happened in the show... an early Season Two episode)

Well, to be fair, she was just giving him a massage.&gt; ~~dark descent~~

Dark ascensionIf you want something that might appeal a little bit more to you maybe try the first two episodes? They introduce the characters as well as contain a bit more action. There's still the heavy handedness but it certainly had a different feeling than the episode you watched. http://pinkie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/rsz/mlfw10598_medium.png[](/twistare) and you are the true color of bacon. [](/sp)

[](/flutternice) fun fact, i'm actually from HERE, not the Plounge. I arrived at the Plounge a day after I really started here.  [](/sp) 

-GM, master of signing posts. I could recommend a Spike-centric episode if you like.  

My favorite Spike Episode is "A Dog and Pony Show". S1E19 But he shares a lot of that episode with the white pony, Rarity.

[](/spikeapproves)Spike's lazy, carefree attitude was more pronounced in the first few seasons, so you might also like S1E24 "Owl's Well That Ends Well" and S2E10 "Secret of My Excess"

[](/sp)

[](/rdwut)The real Rarity would never wear sweat pants.I'm gonna go right ahead and assume they *are* capris, with a do-nothing decorative drawstring bow. [](/quibble) Excuse me, but I can't take any humanized character with that color seriously. That black shirt is completely out of character for ANY member of the Six.[](/ajfrown) Ah can't rightly see Rarity wearin' sweatpants in this situation, either. 

[](/sp)

[](/ppboring) She'd look much better in white jeans or capris. 

[](/cocosmile) But the current fashion trends say that black goes with everything. Black is the new black.Love Ki's work. Glad to see it here \^\^.[](/lyra) I was thinking that at first, but then again she's born and raised in small town Ponyville. 

So: she's chic on top, but meek at the bottom.SPOILER WARNING FOR THE FILM:
[This new toy confirms that hippogriffs exist in Equestria: https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9XFTJkPHhSY/WKizvcyoAyI/AAAAAAACwok/MR3bi4OOZjMbNLrgQzyTAWlUZaNkyikXQCLcB/s1600/NEW%2BMOVIE%2BCHARACTER%2BSTRATUS%2BSKYGUARD%2B2.jpg](/spoiler)Alright, editted it.[](/sbbook) I have a feeling that if hippogriffs ever become canon in MLP they're going to be treated as a completely separate species unrelated to ponies or griffons and not a "hybrid". Cross-bred species just don't really seem like something they'd put into the show. While the show HAS done some minor inter-species relationship stuff with Spike's crush on Rarity, having an actual cross-bred species would have implications far beyond an innocent crush, and cross-species intercourse is a rather touchy subject. Not sure FiM would want to "go there" as it were. 

So considering that fact, I'd say that they probably wouldn't have cutie marks. From everything the show has told us that is strictly a pony-specific thing. The only non-pony that has anything even resembling a cutie mark is Zecora, and hers seems to be more of a stripe pattern than an actual cutie mark. And if hippogriffs end up being unrelated to ponies that likely means no cutie mark. [](/ppshrug) I believe not. Most other equine or equine-like creature that aren't pegasi, unicorns, earth, crystal, zebra or alicorn don't have cutie marks. Changelings don't have them, neither do donkeys. As for the film, sea ponies (not the sea-ponified mane 6) don't have cutie marks and the leaked Hippogriff toy doesn't either. So I think there goes your answerNo idea. Zebras have them, but donkeys don't. Discord, the only other hybrid, does not. So I would lean toward no?[I don't see a mark on that toy. Sorry Silver Quill.](/spoiler)[](/squintyjack) Just typing out "SPOILER WARNING" doesn't really cut it. I'm going to remove this as a spoiler.

\[Spoiler text in here](/spoiler)

and I'll reapprove it.If you had a hippogriff that literally did have a pony for their parent, I think there would be a 50% chance they could have a cutie mark. If we're talking about hippogriff's being a seperate species though, that's a little less likely. Cutie marks seem to be a pony specific thing... even the mark on Zecora's flank seems more like tribal body art than an actual mark.[](/nmm)[Imgur mirror](http://imgur.com/bCRIbjz)

Worth it!I'm honestly speechlessYou gotta get some self awareness dude. This looks really bad.Does it really? [](/raritywhy) I made this on my phone, probably does look bad on computer [](/raritywhine)[] (/fluttershh) Located on the far east end, above the equator. http://pxls.space/[](/derp) Yeah, I'm now focusing on the Derpy. :D

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

[](/flutteryay) The Fluttershy looks awesome too! :D

I hope she survives the Germany flag attack...[](/flutteryay) I was wondering if that was going to be Fluttershy. Let's do it![](/scootablue) Yeah, a German flag from the 1800s.

[](/scootaplease) They lasted a good long while though!

[](/sp)

(Also someone built a little teenager Fluttershy by the Eye of Sauron, and a derpy Rainbow Dash by Vivec!)That'd be me!

I've been using [this](http://orig15.deviantart.net/f163/f/2012/136/d/a/fluttershy_pixel_by_zztfox-d5003n9.png) as reference.

Having some help would be awesome, I've been building it alone since last night![](/soawesome) Awesome!I'm trying to add environment around them now, but it's proving to be hard http://imgur.com/a/BWJ96

Also, I joined their Discord server, and people there are pretty cool.Did their legs just a little bit ago. Gonna work on the grass now.

Glad to hear the Discord community is good.[](/flutterfear) Hopefully

[](/sp)

[](/derpyshock) Ah, I've been seeing that someone's been trying to build a face over her for a whilehttp://i.imgur.com/5Hc4z8T.png

[](/flutteryay) I think she looks about done!

[](/flutterwhoa) I'm gonna need to sleep now. After this, probably no more pixel placing for a good while. I've had enough for a lifetime these past four days.I'm saddened to report that it's being eaten up by yet another flag...Sounds good!

[](/asleeponthejob)I will set my last pixel, but then it's bed for me. I may be able to help out a little tomorrow, though, if you want it.Yay!

[](/rdsitting) I'm going to try drawing Rainbow next to her :3

[](/derpyhappy) Oh, I found someone drawing [Derpy](https://derpicdn.net/img/2016/2/13/1087283/full.png) on (960,620). Gonna help with that.

Goodnight!All the help would be helpful; I've added a link to the reference image on the parent comment. :D
